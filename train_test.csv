1,7 Ways to Keep Our Environment Clean and Safe ,environment
2,"With environmental issues like water contamination, pollution, and climate change, it’s natural to look for ways we can reverse the damage to our planet and keep our environment clean. Many of us think we’re too small to make a difference, but when enough of us take action, we’ve seen the positive results we can create. ",environment
3,Today we’re looking at the steps – big and small – you can take to keep our environment clean and safe. ,environment
4,"Make your voice heard: vote, sign petitions, contact your leaders ",environment
5,"Your state and local representatives need to hear from you. Never doubt – they’re hearing from special interest groups and big businesses with big money. There are several steps we can take in our individual lives, but let’s face it… your home can’t possibly pollute or waste resources on the same scale as a large factory or corporation. ",environment
6,Here are a few ways you can voice your concerns and ask that corporations are held to standards that protect our planet and keep our environment clean and safe: ,environment
7,Write a letter to your local newspaper. ,environment
8,Attend your city council meeting. ,environment
9,"Find out who your Representatives and Senators are at CallMyCongress.com. Go to their websites, sign up for their newsletters, find out where they stand on issues you care about. ",environment
10,"Take a look at Get Involved: Index of Organizations, a list of nonprofit organizations, by topic, that are working to create fundamental change by educating the public and engaging citizens in grassroots initiatives. ",environment
11,Refuse single-use items (especially plastic) ,environment
12,"Straws, to-go cups, disposable razors, and plastic grocery bags are some ubiquitous examples of single-use products in our economy. Finding a reusable option for these items we use once and toss is a simple way to make a big difference. ",environment
13,"While replacing all single use products with reusable products is best, it can be overwhelming at first. To get started, Lauren at Minimal Domesticity says to consider whether the product will be used for more than an hour. ",environment
14,"If, like a plastic grocery bag, the product’s useful life is less than an hour, try replacing it with a more sustainable alternative. ",environment
15,"One of the best ways to avoid these products is to refuse them before they enter your life. This is how you vote with your dollar. Unsubscribe from mailing lists and catalogs, bring your own bag, order a drink with no straw, and decline unnecessary receipts. ",environment
16,"Buy locally, eat more plants, and compost your food waste ",environment
17,"When shopping, focus on purchasing locally grown products rather than imported goods. Buying locally means less transportation, processing, and packaging. And when it comes to food – local means fresh… which tastes so much more flavorful. ",environment
18,"Eating more vegetables and fewer factory-farmed meats helps reduce greenhouse gases. If your family does eat meat, try decreasing your serving sizes and letting the vegetables take center stage on your plate and in your belly. And when you purchase meat, be sure to buy it from a reputable grass-fed source without hormones or antibiotics. ",environment
19,"Remains of plants and kitchen waste make rich nutrient filled food and manure for plants, helping them grow faster. This process is known as composting. Instead of dumping away your wet waste, you can now use it for the plants in your own home garden. ",environment
20,"Composting reduces the volume in our landfills. Municipal solid waste buried in a landfill doesn’t get enough oxygen and will produce methane. A compost pile, on the other hand, undergoes aerobic decomposition. Because it is exposed to oxygen, either by turning it or through the use of worms and other living organisms, it produces carbon dioxide instead of methane. ",environment
21,Plant trees and landscape with native plants ,environment
22,"Green living areas in our cities and suburbs are vital. Industrialization and suburban sprawl have taken away the trees – our main source of unadulterated oxygen. They’re also beautiful, and they do their part to keep our environment clean. ",environment
23,"By planting a tree today, you can make green space and unadulterated oxygen a reality for our kids. The same goes for landscaping with native plants. Not only are they low maintenance, they conserve water, reduce carbon pollution, and support the health of local wildlife. If you don’t have your own lawn, you can donate a tree via charitable organizations like the Plant A Tree Foundation. ",environment
24,Green your transportation and travel habits ,environment
25,"As much as 90% of road transportation in the U.S. is dependent upon oil. When you walk, bike, or take public transportation, you’ll reduce your carbon footprint significantly. If you must drive, make your errands at less busy times of day so you won’t sit in traffic wasting gas. And try to consolidate your outings – being conscious of how many separate trips you can prevent (this also saves time). ",environment
26,"When it comes to vacations, opt for local destinations. Why not see all the beautiful natural resources your own town or state has to offer? If you must travel by air, consider buying carbon credits to offset the environmental impact. ",environment
27,Conserve water ,environment
28,"With industries dumping waste into our water supplies, our access to fresh, clean drinking water is dwindling. Running taps, long showers, running the dishwasher half-full, and unchecked water leaks examples of unnecessary water waste. Try rainwater harvesting in buckets or a rain barrel which can be used to water the plants in the lawn, clean your cars etc. ",environment
29,Reduce use of chemicals & properly dispose of waste ,environment
30,"Instead of purchasing disposable items like plastic plates, spoons and cups, opt for reusable, washable flatware instead. Get an extra set at Goodwill. It doesn’t matter if they match. For on-the-go coffee lovers, carry your reusable travel mug to the coffee shop. With this small, simple act, you reduce the amount of trash you’re disposing and your coffee remains hot while doing so. ",environment
31,"Many industries dispose of their oil, paint, ammonia and other chemicals openly. This is hazardous to water and air as these chemicals are soaked into the groundwater. ",environment
32,"When all of these chemicals combine, it’s no wonder cancer rates have skyrocketed. Support regulations and incentives for companies to keep our environment clean. Agriculture is also a known polluter when it comes to chemical runoff. And when it comes to your own back yard, avoid over-fertilizing to make sure you’re not contributing to algae blooms from runoff. ",environment
33,"Choose natural cleaning methods, environmentally-safer paints, and recycled or nontoxic home improvement materials to keep your indoor air cleaner (and naturally fresh) and your waste less harmful. ",environment
34,Fall in love with Mother Nature ,environment
35,"“There is mounting research that supports the idea that children [and adults] who spend regular time playing and learning in the natural world are happier, healthier, smarter, more creative and better problem solvers,” shares Janice Swaisgood, Children & Nature Network’s National Coordinator of Nature Clubs for Families. ",environment
36,"Essentially if we want to be inspired to protect our natural resources, we must fall in love with nature. Go out and wade in a spring, swim in a lake, and walk or play on the beach. Put down your phone, and go outside to see what kind of birds and butterflies are fluttering about your yard. When you find a bird nest and observe (not interfere) with the hatching, growing, and finally flying away… you develop an intrinsic vested interest or ownership in the natural world. ",environment
37,"Striking a balance between ethical development and a healthy environment may take decades, even centuries. But together, we can become better stewards of this planet we share as our home. ",environment
38,Additional Resources for Reducing Your Impact and Keeping Our Environment Clean ,environment
39,"Since 2010, Green Child has published a digital magazine devoted to natural parenting and conscious living. Hailed as “good for a green mama’s soul,” Green Child has grown into a resource valued by parents who care about bringing simplicity, compassion, social responsibility, and instinctual intelligence back to parenting.

57,"Environmental technology (envirotech), green technology (greentech) or clean technology (cleantech) is the application of one or more of environmental science, green chemistry, environmental monitoring and electronic devices to monitor, model and conserve the natural environment and resources, and to curb the negative impacts of human involvement. The term is also used to describe sustainable energy generation technologies such as photovoltaics, wind turbines, bioreactors, etc. Sustainable development is the core of environmental technologies. The term environmental technologies is also used to describe a class of electronic devices that can promote sustainable management of resources. ",environment
58,"Renewable energy is the energy that can be replenished easily. For years we have been using sources such as wood, sun, water, etc. for means for producing energy. Energy that can be produced by natural objects like wood, sun, wind, etc. is considered to be renewable. ",environment
59,"Water purification: The whole idea/concept of having dirt/germ/pollution free water flowing throughout the environment. Many other phenomena lead from this concept of purification of water. Water pollution is the main enemy of this concept, and various campaigns and activists have been organized around the world to help purify water.[1] ",environment
60,"Air purification: Basic and common green plants can be grown indoors to keep air fresh because all plants remove CO2 and convert it into oxygen. The best examples are: Dypsis lutescens, Sansevieria trifasciata, and Epipremnum aureum.[2] It should also be noted that besides using the plants themselves, some species of bacteria can also be added to the leaves of these plants to help remove toxic gases, such as toluene[3][4][5] ",environment
61,"Sewage treatment is conceptually similar to water purification. Sewage treatments are very important as they purify water per levels of its pollution. The most polluted water is not used for anything, and the least polluted water is supplied to places where water is used affluently. It may lead to various other concepts of environmental protection, sustainability etc.[6] ",environment
62,"Environmental remediation is the removal of pollutants or contaminants for the general protection of the environment. This is accomplished by various chemical, biological, and bulk methods.[7] ",environment
63,"Net Zero Court zero emissions office building prototype in St. Louis, Missouri ",environment
64,"Solid waste management is the purification, consumption, reuse, disposal and treatment of solid waste that is undertaken by the government or the ruling bodies of a city/town.[8] ",environment
65,"Egain forecasting is a method using forecasting technology to predict the future weather's impact on a building.[9] By adjusting the heat based on the weather forecast, the system eliminates redundant use of heat, thus reducing the energy consumption and the emission of greenhouse gases.[10] ",environment
66,Energy conservation is the utilization of devices that require smaller amounts of energy in order to reduce the consumption of electricity. Reducing the use of electricity causes less fossil fuels to be burned to provide that electricity. ,environment
67,The Tesla Roadster (2008) was the first all-electric sports car for sale and in serial production. It can completely recharge from the electrical grid in 4 to 48 hours depending on the outlet used. ,environment
68,"Concerns over pollution and greenhouse gases have spurred the search for sustainable alternatives to our current fuel use. For example, biogas from anaerobic digestion of plant waste can be stored to produce heat or electricity. The global reduction of greenhouse gases requires the adoption of energy conservation as well as sustainable generation. That environmental harm reduction involves global changes such as: ",environment
69,reducing air pollution and methane from biomass ,environment
70,"virtually eliminating fossil fuels for vehicles, heat and electricity, left in the ground. ",environment
71,"wide spread use of public transport, battery and fuel cell vehicles ",environment
72,more wind/solar/water generated electricity ,environment
73,reducing peak demands with carbon taxes and time of use pricing. ,environment
74,"Since fuel used by industry and transportation account for the majority of world demand, by investing in conservation and efficiency (using less fuel), pollution and greenhouse gases from these two sectors can be reduced around the globe. Advanced energy efficient electric motor (and electric generator) technology that are cost effective to encourage their application, such as variable speed generators and efficient energy use, can reduce the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) that would otherwise be introduced to the atmosphere, if electricity were generated using fossil fuels. Greasestock is an event held yearly in Yorktown Heights, New York which is one of the largest showcases of environmental technology in the United States.[11][12][13][14][15] . Some scholars have expressed concern that the implementation of new environmental technologies in highly-developed national economies may cause economic and social disruption in less-developed economies.[16] ",environment
75,Courses aimed at developing graduates with specific skills in environmental systems or environmental technology are becoming more common and fall into three broads classes: ,environment

111,What is renewable energy? ,environment
112,Renewable energy is energy from sources that are naturally replenishing but flow-limited; renewable resources are virtually inexhaustible in duration but limited in the amount of energy that is available per unit of time. ,environment
113,What role does renewable energy play in the United States? ,environment
114,"Until the mid-1800s, wood was the source of nearly all of the nation's energy needs for heating, cooking, and lighting. From the late 1800’s until today, fossil fuels—coal, petroleum, and natural gas—have been the major sources of energy. Hydropower and solid biomass were the most used renewable energy resources until the 1990s. Since then, the shares of U.S. energy consumption from biofuels, solar, and wind energy have increased. ",environment
115,"In 2018, renewable energy provided about 11.5 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu)—1 quadrillion is the number 1 followed by 15 zeros—equal to 11% of total U.S. energy consumption. The electric power sector accounted for about 56% of total U.S. renewable energy consumption in 2018, and about 17% of total U.S. electricity generation was from renewable energy sources. ",environment
116,"Renewable energy plays an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Using renewable energy can reduce the use of fossil fuels, which are major sources of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions. ",environment
117,"The consumption of biofuels and other nonhydroelectric renewable energy sources in the United States more than doubled from 2000 to 2018, mainly because of state and federal government requirements and incentives to use renewable energy. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that U.S. renewable energy consumption will continue to increase through 2050. ",environment
118,Wood is our second-largest source of renewable energy ,environment

122,What are the different types of renewable energy? ,environment
123,"Biomass energy—Biomass energy is produced from nonfossilized plant materials. Wood and wood waste are the largest sources of biomass energy in the United States, followed by biofuels and municipal solid waste. ",environment
124,"Wood—Wood biomass includes wood pellets; wood chips from forestry operations; residues from lumber, pulp/paper, and furniture mills; and fuel wood for space heating and cooking. The largest single source of wood energy is black liquor, a residue of pulp, paper, and paperboard production. ",environment
125,Biofuels—Biofuels include ethanol and biodiesel. Most of the fuel ethanol used in the United States is produced from corn. Biodiesel is made from grain oils and animal fats. ,environment
126,"Municipal solid waste and biogas—Municipal solid waste (MSW), or garbage, contains biomass (or biogenic) materials such as paper, cardboard, food scraps, grass clippings, leaves, wood, leather products, and nonbiomass combustible materials (mainly plastics and other synthetic materials made from petroleum). MSW is burned in waste-to-energy plants to generate electricity. Many landfills in the United States collect and burn biogas to produce electricity. ",environment
127,"Hydropower—Hydropower is electricity produced from flowing water. Most hydropower produced in the United States is from large facilities built by the federal government, such as the Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River in Washington state—the largest single U.S. electric power facility. There are two general types of hydropower: ",environment
128,Conventional hydropower uses water in dams or flowing in streams and rivers to spin a turbine and generate electricity. ,environment
129,Pumped storage systems use and generate electricity by moving water between two reservoirs at different elevations. ,environment
130,"Geothermal energy—Geothermal energy is heat from the hot interior of the earth or near the earth's surface. Fissures in the earth's crust allow water, heated by geothermal energy, to rise naturally to the surface at hot springs and geysers. Wells drilled into the earth allow a controlled release of steam or water to the surface to power steam turbines to generate electricity. The near constant temperature of the earth near the earth's surface is used in geothermal heat pumps for heating and cooling buildings. ",environment
131,"Wind energy—Wind turbines use blades to collect the wind's kinetic energy. Wind flows over the blades creating lift, which causes the blades to turn. The blades are connected to a drive shaft that turns an electric generator, which produces electricity. ",environment
132,Solar energy—Solar energy systems use radiation from the sun to produce heat and electricity. There are three basic categories of solar energy systems: ,environment
133,Solar thermal systems use solar collectors to absorb solar radiation to heat water or air for space heating and water heating. ,environment
134,Solar thermal power plants use concentrating solar collectors to focus the sun's rays to heat a fluid to a high temperature. This fluid generates steam to power a turbine and a generator. ,environment
135,Photovoltaic (PV) systems use solar electric cells that convert solar radiation directly into electricity. Individual PV cells are arranged into modules (panels) of varying electricity-producing capacities. PV systems range from single PV cells for powering calculators to large power plants with hundreds of modules to generate large amounts of electricity. ,environment
136,Renewable energy requirements and incentives ,environment
137,"Federal, state, and local governments and electric utilities encourage investing in and using renewable energy and, in some cases, require it. Many programs and incentives are currently available. The Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency® (DSIRE) is a comprehensive source of information on government and utility requirements and incentives for renewable energy. ",environment
138,"Government financial incentives Several federal government tax credits, grants, and loan programs are available for qualifying renewable energy technologies and projects. The federal tax incentives, or credits, for qualifying renewable energy projects or equipment include the Renewable Electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC), the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), the Residential Energy Credit, and the Modified Accelerated Cost-Recovery System (MACRS). Grant and loan programs may be available from several government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and the U.S. Department of the Interior. Most states have some financial incentives available to support or subsidize the installation of renewable energy equipment. ",environment

141,Renewable portfolio standards (RPS) and state mandates or goals A renewable portfolio standard (RPS) typically requires that a percentage of electric power sales in a state comes from renewable energy sources. Some states have specific mandates for power generation from renewable energy and some states have voluntary goals. Compliance with RPS policies will sometimes require or allow trading of Renewable Energy Certificates. ,environment
142,"Renewable Energy Certificates or Credits (RECs) RECs, also known as green certificates, green tags, or tradable renewable certificates, are financial products that are available for sale, purchase, or trade. RECs allow a purchaser to pay for renewable generation without directly obtaining the electricity generated from qualifying energy sources. ",environment

145,"Net metering Net metering allows electric utility customers to install qualifying renewable energy systems on their properties and to connect the systems to an electric utility's distribution system (or grid). The programs vary, but in general, electric utilities bill their net metering customers for the net amount of electricity the customers use during a defined period. The net amount is the customer's total electricity consumption minus the amount of electricity that the customer's renewable system generates. In some states, customers can sell the excess electricity that they generate with their systems to the utility. As of November 2017, 38 states and the District of Columbia have state-developed mandatory net metering rules for certain utilities. Two states do not have statewide rules, but some utilities in those two states allow net metering, and seven states have statewide-distributed generation compensation rules other than net metering. Most net metered systems are solar photovoltaic systems. ",environment
146,"Feed-in tariffs (FITs) Several states and individual electric utilities in the United States have established special rates for purchasing electricity from certain types of renewable energy systems. These rates, sometimes known as feed-in tariffs (FITs), are generally higher than retail electricity rates to encourage new projects of specific types of renewable energy technologies. ",environment
147,"Green power purchasing Consumers in nearly every state can purchase green power, which represents electricity generated from specific types of renewable energy resources. Most of these voluntary programs generally involve the physical or contractual delivery of the electricity generation resource to the customer or utility. ",environment

150,"Ethanol and other renewable motor fuels Several federal and state requirements and incentives are in effect for the production, sale, and use of ethanol, biodiesel, and other fuels made from biomass. The federal Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires that 36 billion gallons of biofuels be used in the United States per year by 2022. Several states have their own renewable fuel standards or requirements. Other federal programs provide financial support and incentives for ethanol and other biofuels producers. Many states have their own programs that support or promote the use of biofuels. The DOE's Alternative Fuel Data Center is a source of information on these types of programs. ",environment
151,Renewables research and development The DOE and other federal government agencies fund research and development of renewable energy technologies. Most of the research and development is carried out at the National Labs and in cooperation with academic institutions and private companies. The availability of these programs depends on annual appropriations from the United States Congress. ,environment
152,What are renewable portfolio standards? ,environment
153,Source: Stock photography (copyrighted) ,environment
154,Did you know? ,environment
155,"As of July 2018, 29 states and the District of Columbia had enforceable renewable portfolio standards (RPS) or other mandated renewable energy policies, and 8 states had voluntary goals or objectives for renewable energy generation. ",environment
156,"Renewable portfolio standards (RPS), also referred to as renewable electricity standards (RES), are policies designed to increase the use of renewable energy sources for electricity generation. These policies require or encourage electricity suppliers to provide their customers with a stated minimum share of electricity from eligible renewable resources. Although national RPS or other clean energy policies have been proposed, no federal RPS or similar policy is currently in place. However, most states have enacted their own RPS programs. ",environment
157,How have RPS programs been implemented? ,environment
158,"State RPS programs vary widely in terms of program structure, enforcement mechanisms, size, and application. No two state programs are exactly the same. ",environment
159,"A wide range of policies fall under the RPS umbrella. In general, RPS set a minimum requirement for the share of electricity supply that comes from designated renewable energy resources by a certain date or year. Generally, these resources include wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, and some types of hydroelectricity, but they may also include other resources such as landfill gas, municipal solid waste, and ocean energy. Some programs also give credits for various types of renewable space heating and water heating, fuel cells, energy efficiency measures, and advanced fossil-fueled technologies. ",environment
160,"Some states set targets for specific types of renewable energy sources or technologies to encourage the development and use of those resources. Some states focus the RPS requirement on large investor-owned utilities, while others apply the standards to all utilities. Details on state RPS programs are available in the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency® (DSIRE). ",environment
161,"A common feature of RPS policies is a renewable electricity credit (REC) trading system that reduces the cost to comply with the RPS. A utility that generates more renewable electricity than the RPS requirement may either trade or sell RECs to other electricity suppliers who may not have enough RPS-eligible electricity to meet their RPS requirements. Some states make a certain number of credits available for sale. In general, only one entity—the generator or the REC holder—may take credit for the renewable attribute of generation from RPS-eligible sources. In addition to the cost control mechanism of a REC, many RPS programs have escape clauses if renewable generation exceeds a specified cost threshold. ",environment
162,Does an RPS program increase levels of electricity generation from eligible renewable resources? ,environment

This energy consumption is divided as 8.9% coming from traditional biomass, 4.2% as heat energy (modern biomass, geothermal and solar heat), 3.9% from hydroelectricity and the remaining 2.2% is electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and other forms of biomass. Worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than US$286 billion in 2015.[5] Globally, there are an estimated 7.7 million jobs associated with the renewable energy industries, with solar photovoltaics being the largest renewable employer.[6] Renewable energy systems are rapidly becoming more efficient and cheaper and their share of total energy consumption is increasing.[7] As of 2019[update] worldwide, more than two-thirds of all new electricity capacity installed was renewable.[8] Growth in consumption of coal and oil could end by 2020 due to increased uptake of renewables and natural gas.[9][10] ",environment

177,"Renewable energy resources and significant opportunities for energy efficiency exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries. Rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency, and technological diversification of energy sources, would result in significant energy security and economic benefits.[16] It would also reduce environmental pollution such as air pollution caused by burning of fossil fuels and improve public health, reduce premature mortalities due to pollution and save associated health costs that amount to several hundred billion dollars annually only in the United States.[24] Renewable energy sources, that derive their energy from the sun, either directly or indirectly, such as hydro and wind, are expected to be capable of supplying humanity energy for almost another 1 billion years, at which point the predicted increase in heat from the Sun is expected to make the surface of the earth too hot for liquid water to exist.[25][26][27] ",environment

National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond, and some 120 countries have various policy targets for longer-term shares of renewable energy, including a 20% target of all electricity generated for the European Union by 2020. Some countries have much higher long-term policy targets of up to 100% renewables. Outside Europe, a diverse group of 20 or more other countries target renewable energy shares in the 2020–2030 time frame that range from 10% to 50%. [11] ",environment

Several jurisdictions, including Denmark, Germany, the state of South Australia and some US states have achieved high integration of variable renewables. For example, in 2015 wind power met 42% of electricity demand in Denmark, 23.2% in Portugal and 15.5% in Uruguay. Interconnectors enable countries to balance electricity systems by allowing the import and export of renewable energy. Innovative hybrid systems have emerged between countries and regions.[32] ",environment

182,"Solar water heating makes an important contribution to renewable heat in many countries, most notably in China, which now has 70% of the global total (180 GWth). Most of these systems are installed on multi-family apartment buildings and meet a portion of the hot water needs of an estimated 50–60 million households in China. Worldwide, total installed solar water heating systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over 70 million households. The use of biomass for heating continues to grow as well. In Sweden, national use of biomass energy has surpassed that of oil. Direct geothermal for heating is also growing rapidly.[33] The newest addition to Heating is from Geothermal Heat Pumps which provide both heating and cooling, and also flatten the electric demand curve and are thus an increasing national priority[34][35] (see also Renewable thermal energy).

183,"Bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermentation, mostly from carbohydrates produced in sugar or starch crops such as corn, sugarcane, or sweet sorghum. Cellulosic biomass, derived from non-food sources such as trees and grasses is also being developed as a feedstock for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the USA and in Brazil. Biodiesel can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in Europe. ",environment

Usually, photovoltaic (PV) cells contained in solar panels convert the sun's energy directly into electric energy. The term ""solar vehicle"" usually implies that solar energy is used to power all or part of a vehicle's propulsion. Solar power may be also used to provide power for communications or controls or other auxiliary functions. Solar vehicles are not sold as practical day-to-day transportation devices at present, but are primarily demonstration vehicles and engineering exercises, often sponsored by government agencies. High-profile examples include PlanetSolar and Solar Impulse. However, indirectly solar-charged vehicles are widespread and solar boats are available commercially. ",environment
185,History ,environment
186,"Prior to the development of coal in the mid 19th century, nearly all energy used was renewable. Almost without a doubt the oldest known use of renewable energy, in the form of traditional biomass to fuel fires, dates from more than a million years ago. Use of biomass for fire did not become commonplace until many hundreds of thousands of years later.[36] Probably the second oldest usage of renewable energy is harnessing the wind in order to drive ships over water. This practice can be traced back some 7000 years, to ships in the Persian Gulf and on the Nile.[37] From hot springs, geothermal energy has been used for bathing since Paleolithic times and for space heating since ancient Roman times.[38] Moving into the time of recorded history, the primary sources of traditional renewable energy were human labor, animal power, water power, wind, in grain crushing windmills, and firewood, a traditional biomass. ",environment
187,In the 1860s and 1870s there were already fears that civilization would run out of fossil fuels and the need was felt for a better source. In 1873 Professor Augustin Mouchot wrote: ,environment
188,"The time will arrive when the industry of Europe will cease to find those natural resources, so necessary for it. Petroleum springs and coal mines are not inexhaustible but are rapidly diminishing in many places. Will man, then, return to the power of water and wind? Or will he emigrate where the most powerful source of heat sends its rays to all? History will show what will come.[39] ",environment
189,"In conclusion, I would say that however great the scientific importance of this discovery may be, its practical value will be no less obvious when we reflect that the supply of solar energy is both without limit and without cost, and that it will continue to pour down upon us for countless ages after all the coal deposits of the earth have been exhausted and forgotten.[40] ",environment
190,"Max Weber mentioned the end of fossil fuel in the concluding paragraphs of his Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus (The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism), published in 1905.[41] Development of solar engines continued until the outbreak of World War I. The importance of solar energy was recognized in a 1911 Scientific American article: ""in the far distant future, natural fuels having been exhausted [solar power] will remain as the only means of existence of the human race"".[42] ",environment
191,"The theory of peak oil was published in 1956.[43] In the 1970s environmentalists promoted the development of renewable energy both as a replacement for the eventual depletion of oil, as well as for an escape from dependence on oil, and the first electricity-generating wind turbines appeared. Solar had long been used for heating and cooling, but solar panels were too costly to build solar farms until 1980.[44] ",environment
192,"Air flow can be used to run wind turbines. Modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around 600 kW to 9 MW of rated power. The power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed, so as wind speed increases, power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine.[47] Areas where winds are stronger and more constant, such as offshore and high-altitude sites, are preferred locations for wind farms. Typically, full load hours of wind turbines vary between 16 and 57 percent annually, but might be higher in particularly favorable offshore sites.[48] ",environment
193,"Wind-generated electricity met nearly 4% of global electricity demand in 2015, with nearly 63 GW of new wind power capacity installed. Wind energy was the leading source of new capacity in Europe, the US and Canada, and the second largest in China. In Denmark, wind energy met more than 40% of its electricity demand while Ireland, Portugal and Spain each met nearly 20%. ",environment
194,"Globally, the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production, or 40 times current electricity demand, assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome. This would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas, particularly in areas of higher wind resources, such as offshore. As offshore wind speeds average ~90% greater than that of land, so offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land-stationed turbines.[49] ",environment

197,"Since water is about 800 times denser than air, even a slow flowing stream of water, or moderate sea swell, can yield considerable amounts of energy. There are many forms of water energy: ",environment
198,"Historically, hydroelectric power came from constructing large hydroelectric dams and reservoirs, which are still popular in developing countries.[50] The largest of them are the Three Gorges Dam (2003) in China and the Itaipu Dam (1984) built by Brazil and Paraguay. ",environment
199,"Small hydro systems are hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to 50 MW of power. They are often used on small rivers or as a low-impact development on larger rivers. China is the largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world and has more than 45,000 small hydro installations.[51] ",environment
200,"Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity plants derive energy from rivers without the creation of a large reservoir. The water is typically conveyed along the side of the river valley (using channels, pipes and/or tunnels) until it is high above the valley floor, whereupon it can allowed to fall through a penstock to drive a turbine. This style of generation may still produce a large amount of electricity, such as the Chief Joseph Dam on the Columbia river in the United States.[52] ",environment
201,"Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. For countries having the largest percentage of electricity from renewables, the top 50 are primarily hydroelectric. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity stations larger than 10 GW: the Three Gorges Dam in China, Itaipu Dam across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and Guri Dam in Venezuela.[53] ",environment
202,"Wave power, which captures the energy of ocean surface waves, and tidal power, converting the energy of tides, are two forms of hydropower with future potential; however, they are not yet widely employed commercially. A demonstration project operated by the Ocean Renewable Power Company on the coast of Maine, and connected to the grid, harnesses tidal power from the Bay of Fundy, location of world's highest tidal flow. Ocean thermal energy conversion, which uses the temperature difference between cooler deep and warmer surface waters, currently has no economic feasibility.[54][55] ",environment
203,"A photovoltaic system converts light into electrical direct current (DC) by taking advantage of the photoelectric effect.[59] Solar PV has turned into a multi-billion, fast-growing industry, continues to improve its cost-effectiveness, and has the most potential of any renewable technologies together with CSP.[60][61] Concentrated solar power (CSP) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. CSP-Stirling has by far the highest efficiency among all solar energy technologies. ",environment
204,"In 2011, the International Energy Agency said that ""the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries' energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared"".[57] Italy has the largest proportion of solar electricity in the world; in 2015, solar supplied 7.7% of electricity demand in Italy.[62] In 2017, after another year of rapid growth, solar generated approximately 2% of global power, or 460 TWh.[63] ",environment
205,Geothermal energy ,environment
206,Global geothermal capacity in 2017 was 12.9 GW.[14] ,environment
207,"High Temperature Geothermal energy is from thermal energy generated and stored in the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter. Earth's geothermal energy originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of minerals (in currently uncertain[64] but possibly roughly equal[65] proportions). The geothermal gradient, which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface. The adjective geothermal originates from the Greek roots geo, meaning earth, and thermos, meaning heat. ",environment
208,"The heat that is used for geothermal energy can be from deep within the Earth, all the way down to Earth's core – 4,000 miles (6,400 km) down. At the core, temperatures may reach over 9,000 °F (5,000 °C). Heat conducts from the core to surrounding rock. Extremely high temperature and pressure cause some rock to melt, which is commonly known as magma. Magma convects upward since it is lighter than the solid rock. This magma then heats rock and water in the crust, sometimes up to 700 °F (371 °C).[66] ",environment
209,"Low Temperature Geothermal[34] refers to the use of the outer crust of the earth as a Thermal Battery to facilitate Renewable thermal energy for heating and cooling buildings, and other refrigeration and industrial uses. In this form of Geothermal, a Geothermal Heat Pump and Ground-coupled heat exchanger are used together to move heat energy into the earth (for cooling) and out of the earth (for heating) on a varying seasonal basis. Low temperature Geothermal (generally referred to as ""GHP"") is an increasingly important renewable technology because it both reduces total annual energy loads associated with heating and cooling, and it also flattens the electric demand curve eliminating the extreme summer and winter peak electric supply requirements. Thus Low Temperature Geothermal/GHP is becoming an increasing national priority with multiple tax credit support[67] and focus as part of the ongoing movement toward Net Zero Energy.[35] ",environment
210,"Biomass is biological material derived from living, or recently living organisms. It most often refers to plants or plant-derived materials which are specifically called lignocellulosic biomass.[68] As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel. Conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into: thermal, chemical, and biochemical methods. Wood remains the largest biomass energy source today;[69] examples include forest residues – such as dead trees, branches and tree stumps –, yard clippings, wood chips and even municipal solid waste. In the second sense, biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial chemicals, including biofuels. Industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants, including miscanthus, switchgrass, hemp, corn, poplar, willow, sorghum, sugarcane, bamboo,[70] and a variety of tree species, ranging from eucalyptus to oil palm (palm oil). ",environment
211,"Plant energy is produced by crops specifically grown for use as fuel that offer high biomass output per hectare with low input energy.[71] The grain can be used for liquid transportation fuels while the straw can be burned to produce heat or electricity. Plant biomass can also be degraded from cellulose to glucose through a series of chemical treatments, and the resulting sugar can then be used as a first generation biofuel. ",environment
212,"Biomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy such as methane gas or transportation fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. Rotting garbage, and agricultural and human waste, all release methane gas – also called landfill gas or biogas. Crops, such as corn and sugarcane, can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel, ethanol. Biodiesel, another transportation fuel, can be produced from left-over food products such as vegetable oils and animal fats.[72] Also, biomass to liquids (BTLs) and cellulosic ethanol are still under research.[73][74] There is a great deal of research involving algal fuel or algae-derived biomass due to the fact that it is a non-food resource and can be produced at rates 5 to 10 times those of other types of land-based agriculture, such as corn and soy. Once harvested, it can be fermented to produce biofuels such as ethanol, butanol, and methane, as well as biodiesel and hydrogen. The biomass used for electricity generation varies by region. Forest by-products, such as wood residues, are common in the United States. Agricultural waste is common in Mauritius (sugar cane residue) and Southeast Asia (rice husks). Animal husbandry residues, such as poultry litter, are common in the United Kingdom.[75] ",environment
213,"Biofuels include a wide range of fuels which are derived from biomass. The term covers solid, liquid, and gaseous fuels.[76] Liquid biofuels include bioalcohols, such as bioethanol, and oils, such as biodiesel. Gaseous biofuels include biogas, landfill gas and synthetic gas. Bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermenting the sugar components of plant materials and it is made mostly from sugar and starch crops. These include maize, sugarcane and, more recently, sweet sorghum. The latter crop is particularly suitable for growing in dryland conditions, and is being investigated by International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics for its potential to provide fuel, along with food and animal feed, in arid parts of Asia and Africa.[77] ",environment
214,"With advanced technology being developed, cellulosic biomass, such as trees and grasses, are also used as feedstocks for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the United States and in Brazil. The energy costs for producing bio-ethanol are almost equal to, the energy yields from bio-ethanol. However, according to the European Environment Agency, biofuels do not address global warming concerns.[78] Biodiesel is made from vegetable oils, animal fats or recycled greases. It can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, or more commonly as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in Europe. Biofuels provided 2.7% of the world's transport fuel in 2010.[79] ",environment
215,"Biomass, biogas and biofuels are burned to produce heat/power and in doing so harm the environment. Pollutants such as sulphurous oxides (SOx), nitrous oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM) are produced from the combustion of biomass; the World Health Organisation estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by air pollution.[80] Biomass combustion is a major contributor.[80][81][82] ",environment
216,Integration into the energy system ,environment
217,"Renewable energy production from some sources such as wind and solar is more variable and more geographically spread than technology based on fossil fuels and nuclear. While integrating it into the wider energy system is feasible, it does lead to some additional challenges. In order for the energy system to remain stable, a set of measurements can be taken. Implementation of energy storage, using a wide variety of renewable energy technologies, and implementing a smart grid in which energy is automatically used at the moment it is produced can reduce risks and costs of renewable energy implementation.[83] ",environment
218,Electrical energy storage ,environment
219,"Electrical energy storage is a collection of methods used to store electrical energy. Electrical energy is stored during times when production (especially from intermittent sources such as wind power, tidal power, solar power) exceeds consumption, and returned to the grid when production falls below consumption. Pumped-storage hydroelectricity accounts for more than 90% of all grid power storage. Costs of lithium-ion batteries are dropping rapidly, and are increasingly being deployed grid ancillary services and for domestic storage. ",environment

Of the renewables total, wind accounted for 72 GW and solar photovoltaics 56 GW; both record-breaking numbers and sharply up from 2014 figures (49 GW and 45 GW respectively). In financial terms, solar made up 56% of total new investment and wind accounted for 38%. ",environment

In 2015, worldwide installed photovoltaics capacity increased to 227 gigawatts (GW), sufficient to supply 1 percent of global electricity demands.[91] Solar thermal energy stations operate in the United States and Spain, and as of 2016, the largest of these is the 392 MW Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System in California.[92][93] The world's largest geothermal power installation is The Geysers in California, with a rated capacity of 750 MW. Brazil has one of the largest renewable energy programs in the world, involving production of ethanol fuel from sugar cane, and ethanol now provides 18% of the country's automotive fuel. Ethanol fuel is also widely available in the United States. ",environment

A 2018 report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), found that the cost of renewable energy is quickly falling, and will likely be equal to or less than the cost non-renewables such as fossil fuels by 2020. The report found that solar power costs have dropped 73% since 2010 and onshore wind costs have dropped by 23% in that same timeframe.[105] ",environment
230,"Current projections concerning the future cost of renewables vary however. The EIA has predicted that almost two thirds of net additions to power capacity will come from renewables by 2020 due to the combined policy benefits of local pollution, decarbonisation and energy diversification.

Renewable energy costs continue to drop, and the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) is declining for wind power, solar photovoltaic (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP) and some biomass technologies.[107] Renewable energy is also the most economic solution for new grid-connected capacity in areas with good resources. As the cost of renewable power falls, the scope of economically viable applications increases. Renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity. Where ""oil-fired generation is the predominant power generation source (e.g. on islands, off-grid and in some countries) a lower-cost renewable solution almost always exists today"".[107] A series of studies by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory modeled the ""grid in the Western US under a number of different scenarios where intermittent renewables accounted for 33 percent of the total power."" In the models, inefficiencies in cycling the fossil fuel plants to compensate for the variation in solar and wind energy resulted in an additional cost of ""between $0.47 and $1.28 to each MegaWatt hour generated""; however, the savings in the cost of the fuels saved ""adds up to $7 billion, meaning the added costs are, at most, two percent of the savings.""[108] ",environment

However, the political realities of new reservoirs in western countries, economic limitations in the third world and the lack of a transmission system in undeveloped areas, result in the possibility of developing 25% of the remaining potential before 2050, with the bulk of that being in the Asia Pacific area.[109] There is slow growth taking place in Western counties,[citation needed] but not in the conventional dam and reservoir style of the past. New projects take the form of run-of-the-river and small hydro, neither using large reservoirs. It is popular to repower old dams thereby increasing their efficiency and capacity as well as quicker responsiveness on the grid.[110] Where circumstances permit existing dams such as the Russell Dam built in 1985 may be updated with ""pump back"" facilities for pumped-storage which is useful for peak loads or to support intermittent wind and solar power.

From 2004 to 2017, worldwide installed capacity of wind power has been growing from 47 GW to 514 GW—a more than tenfold increase within 13 years[14] As of the end of 2014, China, the United States and Germany combined accounted for half of total global capacity.[88] Several other countries have achieved relatively high levels of wind power penetration, such as 21% of stationary electricity production in Denmark, 18% in Portugal, 16% in Spain, and 14% in Ireland in 2010 and have since continued to expand their installed capacity.[112][113] More than 80 countries around the world are using wind power on a commercial basis.[79] ",environment
238,"As of 2017, offshore wind power amounted to 18.7 GW of global installed capacity, accounting for only 3.6% of the total wind power capacity.[14] The United Kingdom is the undisputed leader of offshore power with half of the world's installed capacity ahead of Denmark, Germany, Belgium and China.[117] ",environment
239,"As of 2013, the Alta Wind Energy Center (California, 1.5 GW) is the world's largest single wind farm.[118] The Walney Extension (London, 0.7 GW) is the largest offshore wind farm in the world. Gansu Wind Farm (China, 7.9 GW) is the largest wind energy project generating project consisting of 18 wind farms.[119] ",environment

247,Photovoltaics (PV) is rapidly-growing with global capacity increasing from 177 GW at the end of 2014 to 385 GW in 2017.[14] ,environment
248,"Photovoltaics grew fastest in China, followed by Japan and the United States. Italy meets 7.9 percent of its electricity demands with photovoltaic power—the highest share worldwide.[127] Solar power is forecasted to become the world's largest source of electricity by 2050, with solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar power contributing 16% and 11%, respectively. This requires an increase of installed PV capacity to 4,600 GW, of which more than half is expected to be deployed in China and India.[128] ",environment
249,"Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. As the cost of solar electricity has fallen, the number of grid-connected solar PV systems has grown into the millions and utility-scale solar power stations with hundreds of megawatts are being built. Many solar photovoltaic power stations have been built, mainly in Europe, China and the United States.[129] The 1.5 GW Tengger Desert Solar Park, in China is the world's largest PV power station. Many of these plants are integrated with agriculture and some use tracking systems that follow the sun's daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than fixed-mounted systems.

253,"Mandates for blending biofuels exist in 31 countries at the national level and in 29 states/provinces.[79] According to the International Energy Agency, biofuels have the potential to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050.[131] ",environment
254,"Since the 1970s, Brazil has had an ethanol fuel program which has allowed the country to become the world's second largest producer of ethanol (after the United States) and the world's largest exporter.[132] Brazil's ethanol fuel program uses modern equipment and cheap sugarcane as feedstock, and the residual cane-waste (bagasse) is used to produce heat and power.[133] There are no longer light vehicles in Brazil running on pure gasoline. By the end of 2008 there were 35,000 filling stations throughout Brazil with at least one ethanol pump.[134] Unfortunately, Operation Car Wash has seriously eroded public trust in oil companies and has implicated several high ranking Brazilian officials. ",environment
255,"Nearly all the gasoline sold in the United States today is mixed with 10% ethanol,[135] and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends. Ford, Daimler AG, and GM are among the automobile companies that sell ""flexible-fuel"" cars, trucks, and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85% ethanol. By mid-2006, there were approximately 6 million ethanol compatible vehicles on U.S. roads.[136] ",environment

Recent technological advances have expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation. Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are usually much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels. As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels. ",environment

262,Solar cookers use sunlight as energy source for outdoor cooking ,environment
263,"Renewable energy technology has sometimes been seen as a costly luxury item by critics, and affordable only in the affluent developed world. This erroneous view has persisted for many years, however between 2016 and 2017, investments in renewable energy were higher in developing countries than in devloped countries, with China leading global investment with a record 126.6 billion dollars. Many Latin American and African countries increased their investments significantly as well.[139] Renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries. In rural and remote areas, transmission and distribution of energy generated from fossil fuels can be difficult and expensive. Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative.[140] ",environment
264,"Technology advances are opening up a huge new market for solar power: the approximately 1.3 billion people around the world who don't have access to grid electricity. Even though they are typically very poor, these people have to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps. Solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene.[141] As of 2010, an estimated 3 million households get power from small solar PV systems.[142] Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita. More than 30,000 very small solar panels, each producing 1[143] 2 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually. Some Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are also turning to solar power to reduce their costs and increase their sustainability. ",environment
265,"Micro-hydro configured into mini-grids also provide power. Over 44 million households use biogas made in household-scale digesters for lighting and/or cooking, and more than 166 million households rely on a new generation of more-efficient biomass cookstoves.[30] Clean liquid fuel sourced from renewable feedstocks are used for cooking and lighting in energy-poor areas of the developing world. Alcohol fuels (ethanol and methanol) can be produced sustainably from non-food sugary, starchy, and cellulostic feedstocks. Project Gaia, Inc. and CleanStar Mozambique are implementing clean cooking programs with liquid ethanol stoves in Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria and Mozambique.[144] ",environment
266,"Renewable energy projects in many developing countries have demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to poverty reduction by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment. Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking, space heating, and lighting. Renewable energy can also contribute to education, by providing electricity to schools.[145] ",environment
267,Policy ,environment
268,"Policies to support renewable energy have been vital in their expansion. Where Europe dominated in establishing energy policy in early 2000s, most countries around the world now have some form of energy policy.[146] ",environment
269,Policy trends ,environment
270,"The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) is an intergovernmental organization for promoting the adoption of renewable energy worldwide. It aims to provide concrete policy advice and facilitate capacity building and technology transfer. IRENA was formed in 2009, by 75 countries signing the charter of IRENA.[148] As of April 2019, IRENA has 160 member states.[149] The then United Nations' Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity,[31] and in September 2011 he launched the UN Sustainable Energy for All initiative to improve energy access, efficiency and the deployment of renewable energy.[150] ",environment
271,"The 2015 Paris agreement on climate change motivated many countries to develop or improve renewable energy policies.[11] In 2017, a total of 121 countries have adapted some form of renewable energy policy.[146] National targets that year existed in at 176 countries.[11] In addition, there is also a wide range of policies at state/provincial and local levels.[79] Some public utilities help plan or install residential energy upgrades. Under president Barack Obama, the United States policy encouraged the uptake of renewable energy in line with commitments to the Paris agreement. Even though Trump has abandoned these goals, renewable investment is still on the rise.[151] ",environment
272,"Many national, state, and local governments have created green banks. A green bank is a quasi-public financial institution that uses public capital to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies.[152] Green banks use a variety of financial tools to bridge market gaps that hinder the deployment of clean energy. The US military has also focused on the use of renewable fuels for military vehicles. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable fuels can be produced in any country, creating a strategic advantage. The US military has already committed itself to have 50% of its energy consumption come from alternative sources.[153] ",environment

274,This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (March 2019) ,environment
275,"The incentive to use 100% renewable energy, for electricity, transport, or even total primary energy supply globally, has been motivated by global warming and other ecological as well as economic concerns. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated.[154] At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply. Also, Professors S. Pacala and Robert H. Socolow have developed a series of ""stabilization wedges"" that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change, and ""renewable energy sources,"" in aggregate, constitute the largest number of their ""wedges"".[155] ",environment
276,"Using 100% renewable energy was first suggested in a Science paper published in 1975 by Danish physicist Bent Sørensen.[156] It was followed by several other proposals, until in 1998 the first detailed analysis of scenarios with very high shares of renewables were published. These were followed by the first detailed 100% scenarios. In 2006 a PhD thesis was published by Czisch in which it was shown that in a 100% renewable scenario energy supply could match demand in every hour of the year in Europe and North Africa. In the same year Danish Energy professor Henrik Lund published a first paper[157] in which he addresses the optimal combination of renewables, which was followed by several other papers on the transition to 100% renewable energy in Denmark. Since then Lund has been publishing several papers on 100% renewable energy. After 2009 publications began to rise steeply, covering 100% scenarios for countries in Europe, America, Australia and other parts of the world.[158] ",environment
277,"In 2011 Mark Z. Jacobson, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, and Mark Delucchi published a study on 100% renewable global energy supply in the journal Energy Policy. They found producing all new energy with wind power, solar power, and hydropower by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be ""primarily social and political, not technological or economic"".[159] They also found that energy costs with a wind, solar, water system should be similar to today's energy costs.[160] ",environment
278,"Similarly, in the United States, the independent National Research Council has noted that ""sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change, energy security, and the escalation of energy costs … Renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the United States, taken collectively, can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand.""[161] ",environment
279,"The most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political and not technological. According to the 2013 Post Carbon Pathways report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: climate change denial, the fossil fuels lobby, political inaction, unsustainable energy consumption, outdated energy infrastructure, and financial constraints.[162] ",environment
280,Emerging technologies ,environment
281,"Other renewable energy technologies are still under development, and include cellulosic ethanol, hot-dry-rock geothermal power, and marine energy.[163] These technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization. Many are on the horizon and may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies, but still depend on attracting sufficient attention and research, development and demonstration (RD&D) funding.[163] ",environment
282,"There are numerous organizations within the academic, federal, and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of renewable energy. This research spans several areas of focus across the renewable energy spectrum. Most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields.[164] Multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on renewable energy in recent years. Two of the most prominent of these labs are Sandia National Laboratories and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), both of which are funded by the United States Department of Energy and supported by various corporate partners.[165] Sandia has a total budget of $2.4 billion[166] while NREL has a budget of $375 million.[167] ",environment
283,"Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) are a new type of geothermal power technologies that do not require natural convective hydrothermal resources. The vast majority of geothermal energy within drilling reach is in dry and non-porous rock.[168] EGS technologies ""enhance"" and/or create geothermal resources in this ""hot dry rock (HDR)"" through hydraulic stimulation. EGS and HDR technologies, such as hydrothermal geothermal, are expected to be baseload resources which produce power 24 hours a day like a fossil plant. Distinct from hydrothermal, HDR and EGS may be feasible anywhere in the world, depending on the economic limits of drill depth. Good locations are over deep granite covered by a thick (3–5 km) layer of insulating sediments which slow heat loss.[169] There are HDR and EGS systems currently being developed and tested in France, Australia, Japan, Germany, the U.S. and Switzerland. The largest EGS project in the world is a 25 megawatt demonstration plant currently being developed in the Cooper Basin, Australia. The Cooper Basin has the potential to generate 5,000–10,000 MW. ",environment
284,"Several refineries that can process biomass and turn it into ethanol are built by companies such as Iogen, POET, and Abengoa, while other companies such as the Verenium Corporation, Novozymes, and Dyadic International[170] are producing enzymes which could enable future commercialization. The shift from food crop feedstocks to waste residues and native grasses offers significant opportunities for a range of players, from farmers to biotechnology firms, and from project developers to investors.[171] ",environment
285,"Marine energy (also sometimes referred to as ocean energy) refers to the energy carried by ocean waves, tides, salinity, and ocean temperature differences. The movement of water in the world's oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy, or energy in motion. This energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes, transport and industries. The term marine energy encompasses both wave power – power from surface waves, and tidal power – obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water. Reverse electrodialysis (RED) is a technology for generating electricity by mixing fresh river water and salty sea water in large power cells designed for this purpose; as of 2016 it is being tested at a small scale (50 kW). Offshore wind power is not a form of marine energy, as wind power is derived from the wind, even if the wind turbines are placed over water. The oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations. Ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world.[172] ",environment
286,"Concentrated photovoltaics (CPV) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for the purpose of electricity generation. Thermoelectric, or ""thermovoltaic"" devices convert a temperature difference between dissimilar materials into an electric current. ",environment
287,Floating solar arrays ,environment
288,"Floating solar arrays are PV systems that float on the surface of drinking water reservoirs, quarry lakes, irrigation canals or remediation and tailing ponds. A small number of such systems exist in France, India, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Singapore and the United States.[175][176][177][178][179] The systems are said to have advantages over photovoltaics on land. The cost of land is more expensive, and there are fewer rules and regulations for structures built on bodies of water not used for recreation. Unlike most land-based solar plants, floating arrays can be unobtrusive because they are hidden from public view. They achieve higher efficiencies than PV panels on land, because water cools the panels. The panels have a special coating to prevent rust or corrosion.[180] In May 2008, the Far Niente Winery in Oakville, California, pioneered the world's first floatovoltaic system by installing 994 solar PV modules with a total capacity of 477 kW onto 130 pontoons and floating them on the winery's irrigation pond.[181] Utility-scale floating PV farms are starting to be built. Kyocera will develop the world's largest, a 13.4 MW farm on the reservoir above Yamakura Dam in Chiba Prefecture[182] using 50,000 solar panels.[183][184] Salt-water resistant floating farms are also being constructed for ocean use.[185] The largest so far announced floatovoltaic project is a 350 MW power station in the Amazon region of Brazil.[186] ",environment
289,"A heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a ""heat sink"". Heat pumps are designed to move thermal energy opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A solar-assisted heat pump represents the integration of a heat pump and thermal solar panels in a single integrated system. Typically these two technologies are used separately (or only placing them in parallel) to produce hot water.[187] In this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pump's evaporator.[188] The goal of this system is to get high COP and then produce energy in a more efficient and less expensive way. ",environment
290,"It is possible to use any type of solar thermal panel (sheet and tubes, roll-bond, heat pipe, thermal plates) or hybrid (mono/polycrystalline, thin film) in combination with the heat pump. The use of a hybrid panel is preferable because it allows covering a part of the electricity demand of the heat pump and reduce the power consumption and consequently the variable costs of the system. ",environment
291,"Artificial photosynthesis uses techniques including nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds by splitting water to produce hydrogen and then using carbon dioxide to make methanol.[189] Researchers in this field are striving to design molecular mimics of photosynthesis which use a wider region of the solar spectrum, employ catalytic systems made from abundant, inexpensive materials that are robust, readily repaired, non-toxic, stable in a variety of environmental conditions and perform more efficiently allowing a greater proportion of photon energy to end up in the storage compounds, i.e., carbohydrates (rather than building and sustaining living cells).[190] However, prominent research faces hurdles, Sun Catalytix a MIT spin-off stopped scaling up their prototype fuel-cell in 2012, because it offers few savings over other ways to make hydrogen from sunlight.[191] ",environment
292,Producing liquid fuels from oil-rich varieties of algae is an ongoing research topic. Various microalgae grown in open or closed systems are being tried including some system that can be set up in brownfield and desert lands. ,environment
293,"Currently, flying manned electric aircraft are mostly experimental demonstrators, though many small unmanned aerial vehicles are powered by batteries. Electrically powered model aircraft have been flown since the 1970s, with one report in 1957.[193][194] The first man-carrying electrically powered flights were made in 1973.[195] Between 2015–2016, a manned, solar-powered plane, Solar Impulse 2, completed a circumnavigation of the Earth.[196] ",environment
294,"The Solar updraft tower is a renewable-energy power plant for generating electricity from low temperature solar heat. Sunshine heats the air beneath a very wide greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall chimney tower. The resulting convection causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the chimney effect. This airflow drives wind turbines placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to produce electricity. Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation, and may allow development of other applications, such as water extraction or distillation, and agriculture or horticulture. A more advanced version of a similarly themed technology is the Vortex engine which aims to replace large physical chimneys with a vortex of air created by a shorter, less-expensive structure. ",environment
295,"For either photovoltaic or thermal systems, one option is to loft them into space, particularly Geosynchronous orbit. To be competitive with Earth-based solar power systems, the specific mass (kg/kW) times the cost to loft mass plus the cost of the parts needs to be $2400 or less. I.e., for a parts cost plus rectenna of $1100/kW, the product of the $/kg and kg/kW must be $1300/kW or less.[197] Thus for 6.5 kg/kW, the transport cost cannot exceed $200/kg. While that will require a 100 to one reduction, SpaceX is targeting a ten to one reduction, Reaction Engines may make a 100 to one reduction possible. ",environment

301,"The market for renewable energy technologies has continued to grow. Climate change concerns and increasing in green jobs, coupled with high oil prices, peak oil, oil wars, oil spills, promotion of electric vehicles and renewable electricity, nuclear disasters and increasing government support, are driving increasing renewable energy legislation, incentives and commercialization.[17] New government spending, regulation and policies helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better than many other sectors.[28][204] ",environment
302,"While renewables have been very successful in their ever-growing contribution to electrical power there are no countries dominated by fossil fuels who have a plan to stop and get that power from renwables. Only Scotland and Ontario have stopped burning coal, largely due to good natural gas supplies.

369,1. Introduction,environment
370,"Today, renewable energy provides only a tiny fraction of its potential electricity output worldwide. But",environment
371,numerous studies have repeatedly shown that renewable energy can be rapidly deployed to provide a,environment
372,"significant share of future electricity needs, even after accounting for potential constraints.",environment

374,"conventional fuels in four distinct areas: electricity generation, hot water/space heating, motor fuels, and",environment
375,rural (off-grid) energy services:,environment
376,1. Power generation. Renewable energy provides 19% of electricity generation worldwide. Renewable,environment
377,"power generators are spread across many countries, and wind power alone already provides a",environment
378,"significant share of electricity in some areas: for example, 14% in the U.S. state of Iowa, 40% in the",environment
379,"northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein, and 49% in Denmark. Some countries get most of",environment
380,"their power from renewables, including Iceland (100%), Norway (98%), Brazil (86%), Austria",environment
381,"(62%), New Zealand (65%), and Sweden (54%).",environment
382,"2. Heating. Solar hot water makes an important contribution to renewable heat in many countries, most",environment
383,"notably in China, which now has 70% of the global total (180 GWh). Most of these systems are",environment
384,installed on multi-family apartment buildings and meet a portion of the hot water needs of an,environment
385,"estimated 50–60 million households in China. Worldwide, total installed solar water heating systems",environment
386,meet a portion of the water heating needs of over 70 million households. The use of biomass for,environment

397,2. Types of Environmental Impacts,environment
398,It is important to understand the environmental impacts associated with producing power from renewable,environment
399,"sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, and hydropower. The exact type and intensity of",environment
400,"environmental impacts varies depending on the specific technology used, the geographic location, and a",environment
401,number of other factors.,environment
402,"Various aspects of the impact of renewable energy sources can be analyzed, including, among others: air",environment
403,"and water emissions, waste generations, specially hazardous materials, noise generation, land use, global",environment
404,warming emissions.,environment
405,By understanding the current and potential environmental issues associated with each renewable energy,environment
406,"source, we can takes steps to effectively avoid or minimize these impacts as they become a larger portion of",environment
407,our electric supply.,environment
408,A whole series of determinants are favouring the development of the energy sector based on renewable,environment
409,"resources: increasing social awareness of the need to limit emissions of harmful substances, legislation,",environment
410,"pro‐environmental policies of governments, by‐laws, support in the form of programmes and financial",environment
411,"mechanisms, not to mention the rising costs of energy from conventional sources and the need to ensure",environment
412,energy security.,environment
413,Because the environmental performance of renewable energy systems is greatly improved by: increased,environment
414,"efficiency and longer lifetimes, both should be stimulated for the devices and whole systems.",environment
415,"What does it mean: environment? The Oxford dictionary (Brown, 1993) defines environment as “the set",environment
416,"of circumstances or conditions … in which a person or community lives, works, develops, etc, or a thing",environment
417,"exists or operates; the external conditions affecting the life of a plant or animal”. In most countries,",environment
418,industrial development is contingent on the developer obtaining a permit from a regulatory authority which,environment
419,involves assessing the impact the development may have on the environment. Preservation of the,environment
420,environment is not merely a local issue but an international concern.,environment
421,The brief comparison between environmental benefits and costs of the use of different types of RES is,environment

442,3. Environmental Impacts of Different Technologies,environment
443,3.1. Environmental Impacts of Wind Power,environment
444,"A wind farm, when installed on agricultural land, has one of the lowest environmental impacts of all",environment
445,energy sources: it occupies less land area per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity generated than any other,environment
446,"energy conversion system, apart from rooftop solar energy, and is compatible with grazing and crops; it",environment
447,"generates the energy used in its construction in just 3 months of operation, yet its operational lifetime is 20–",environment
448,25 years; greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution produced by its construction are very tiny and declining.,environment
449,There are no emissions or pollution produced by its operation; in substituting for base-load (mostly coal,environment
450,"power) wind power produces a net decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, and a net increase",environment
451,in biodiversity; modern wind turbines are almost silent and rotate so slowly (in terms of revolutions per,environment
452,minute) that they are rarely a hazard to birds [2].,environment
453,Modern wind turbine designs have significantly reduced the noise from turbines. Turbine designers are,environment
454,"working to minimise noise, as noise reflects lost energy and output. Noise levels at nearby residences are",environment
455,"managed through the siting of turbines, the approvals process for wind farms and operational management of",environment
456,"the wind farm. The noise limit for wind farms is 35 A-weighted decibels, which is usually around 5 Aweighted decibels above a quiet countryside. Alternatively, the limit is 5 A-weighted decibels above the level",environment
457,"of background noise (i.e. without wind farm noise), if that is greater than 35 A-weighted decibels [3]. Low",environment
458,frequency sound and infrasound (ie usually beneath the threshold of human hearing) are everywhere in the,environment
459,environment. They are emitted from natural sources such as wind and rivers and artificial sources such as,environment
460,traffic and air conditioning. Modern turbine designs which locate the blades upwind instead of downwind,environment
461,have significantly reduced the level of infrasound. Scientific and health authorities have found the low level,environment
462,of infrasound emitted by wind turbines pose no health risks [4].,environment
463,Wind turbines may create shadow flicker on nearby residences when the sun passes behind the turbine.,environment
464,"However, this can easily be avoided by locating the wind farm to avoid unacceptable shadow flicker, or",environment
465,turning the turbine off for the few minutes of the day when the sun is at the angle that causes flicker. Shadow,environment
466,flicker is considered in the NSW development assessment process to ensure potential impacts are addressed,environment
467,"[3]. Many energy policy studies have noted how wind turbines present direct and indirect hazards to birds,",environment
468,"other avian species, and bats [5], [6]. Birds can directly smash into moving or even stationary turbine blades,",environment
469,"crash into towers and nacelles, and collide with local distribution lines. These risks are exacerbated when",environment
470,"turbines are placed on ridges and upwind slopes or built close to migration routes. Some species, such as bats,",environment
471,"face additional risks from the rapid reduction in air pressure near turbine blades, which can cause internal",environment
472,hemorrhaging [7].,environment
473,"Comparative assessment of avian mortality for fossil fuel, nuclear, and wind power plants in the United",environment
474,"States is presented in [8]. It was stated that for wind turbines, the risk appears to be greatest to birds striking",environment
475,"towers or turbine blades. For fossil-fueled power stations, the most significant fatalities come from climate",environment
476,"change, which is altering weather patterns and destroying habitats that birds depend on. For nuclear power",environment
477,"plants, the risk is almost equally spread across hazardous pollution at uranium mine sites and collisions with",environment
478,"draft cooling structures. Yet, taken together, fossil-fueled facilities are about 17 times more dangerous to",environment
479,birds on a per GWh basis than wind and nuclear power stations.,environment
480,Timely decommissioning of turbines that are no longer in use is a standard condition of consent for wind,environment
481,farms in NSW. Decommissioning wind farms is a straightforward task. In Europe many older wind farms are,environment
482,being re-powered with new turbines; this could also be expected to occur in New South Wales. Existing,environment
483,"wind sites have considerable value – the wind resource is well understood and structural foundations,",environment
484,electricity transmission and local community acceptance are already in place [3].,environment
485,3.2. Environmental Impacts of Solar Power,environment
486,"Photovoltaics is now a proven technology which is inherently safe, as opposed to some dangerous",environment
487,electricity generating technologies. Over its estimated life a photovoltaic module will produce much more,environment
488,electricity than was used in its production. A 100 W module will prevent the emission of over two tonnes of,environment
489,CO2. Photovoltaic systems make no noise and cause no pollution while in operation. PV cell technologies,environment
490,106,environment
491,"that have relatively lower environmental risks compared to other types of electric sources. However,",environment
492,"chemicals used in PV cells could be released to air, surface water, and groundwater in the manufacturing",environment
493,"facility, the installation site, and the disposal or recycling facility [9]. The production of photovoltaic devices",environment
494,involves the use of a variety of chemicals and materials. The amounts and types of chemicals used will vary,environment
495,depending upon the type of cell being produced. Based on a review of the chemical information reported in,environment
496,the U.S. EPA’s Toxics Release Inventory System (TRIS) database for six photovoltaic companies producing,environment
497,"solar cells, it appears that most of the chemicals used by the manufacturing companies are not released in",environment
498,reportable quantities. The releases of chemicals to the air from the photovoltaic facilities were reported as,environment
499,both air stack emissions and fugitive air emissions. All six of the photovoltaic companies reviewed reported,environment
500,air stack emissions of some compounds used for cleaning and etching. The chemicals released in the largest,environment
501,"quantities in air stack emissions included 1,1,1-trichloroethane, acetone, ammonia, isopropyl alcohol, and",environment
502,methanol [10]. The scale of the system plays a significant role in the level of environmental impact.,environment
503,"Depending on their location, larger utility-scale solar facilities can raise concerns about land degradation and",environment
504,habitat loss. and impacts from utility-scale solar systems can be minimized by siting them at lower-quality,environment
505,"locations such as abandoned mining land, or existing transportation and transmission corridors [11].",environment
506,"Solar PV cells do not use water for generating electricity. However, as in all manufacturing processes,",environment
507,"some water is used to manufacture solar PV components. Concentrating solar thermal plants (CSP), like all",environment
508,"thermal electric plants, require water for cooling. Water use depends on the plant design, plant location, and",environment
509,the type of cooling system.,environment
510,3.3. Environmental Impacts of Geothermal Energy,environment
511,"Geothermal power is a relatively benign source of energy. For the most part, the impacts of development",environment
512,are positive. Worldwide geothermal energy utilization increases yearly because it is an attractive alternative,environment
513,to burning imported and domestic fossil fuels.,environment
514,Electricity generation from geothermal resources involves much lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emission,environment
515,"rates than that from fossil fuels. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), replacing",environment
516,one kilowatt-hour (kWh) of fossil power with a kilowatt-hour of geothermal power reduces the estimated,environment
517,global warming impact by approximately 95% [1].,environment
518,"However, geothermal development could have certain negative impacts if appropriate mitigation actions",environment
519,and monitoring plants are not in place. Any large-scale construction and drilling operation will produce,environment
520,"visual impacts on the landscape, create noise and wastes and affect local economies. Some countries have",environment
521,"strict environmental regulations regarding some of the impacts associated with geothermal development, and",environment
522,others do not. Environmental issues usually addressed during the development of geothermal fields include,environment
523,"air quality, water quality, waste disposal, geologic hazards, noise, biological resources and land use issues",environment
524,[12].,environment
525,The protection of groundwater is important during the drilling phase. The groundwater is to be managed,environment
526,"sustainably. It is part of the ecosystem, is a habitat for animals and plants, and has a role in the livelihood of",environment
527,"local residents. The main visual impact during the construction phase is the presence of a drilling rig, but",environment
528,once a project is in the production phase the rig is not required and the energy centre footprint is very small.,environment
529,"Because of low emissions, the geothermal power plants also meet the most stringent clean air standards. It",environment
530,should be noted that all geothermal plants have to meet various national and local environmental standards,environment
531,"and regulations, although emissions are not routinely measured below a certain threshold, and emissions",environment
532,from geothermal plants typically fall below this threshold [13].,environment
533,The list of barriers resulting from environmental regulations can be rather long. Environmental,environment
534,"regulations should include groundwater protection incl. pressure issues, soil protection but also protocol on",environment
535,"micro-seismicity, and surface issues. For work safety, construction and traffic, any legislation applicable for",environment
536,"similar activities in mining, drilling, construction, etc. should be applied.",environment
537,3.4. Environmental Impacts of Biomass,environment
538,Biomass power plants share some similarities with fossil fuel power plants: both involve the combustion,environment
539,"of a feedstock to generate electricity. Thus, biomass plants raise similar, but not identical, concerns about air",environment
540,107,environment
541,"emissions and water use as fossil fuel plants. Biomass power plants, like coal- and natural gas-fired power",environment
542,"plants, require water for cooling. Land use impacts from biomass power production are driven primarily by",environment
543,the type of feedstock: either a waste stream or an energy crop that is grown specifically for generating,environment
544,"electricity. There are global warming emissions associated with growing and harvesting biomass feedstock,",environment
545,"transporting feedstock to the power plant, and burning or gasifying the feedstock. Transportation and",environment
546,"combustion emissions are roughly equivalent for all types of biomass. However, global warming emissions",environment
547,from the sourcing of biomass feedstock vary widely. It was once commonly thought that biomass had net,environment
548,"zero global warming emissions, because the growing biomass absorbed an equal amount of carbon as the",environment
549,"amount released through combustion, but now it is understood that some biomass feedstock sources are",environment
550,associated with substantial global warming emissions. Beneficial biomass resources include energy crops,environment
551,"that do not compete with food crops for land, portions of crop residues such as wheat straw or corn stover,",environment
552,"sustainably-harvested wood and forest residues, and clean municipal and industrial wastes [14].",environment
553,3.5. Environmental Impacts of Hydroelectric Power,environment
554,"Although hydropower has no air quality impacts, construction and operation of hydropower dams can",environment
555,significantly affect natural river systems as well as fish and wildlife populations. Assessment of the,environment
556,environmental impacts of a specific hydropower facility requires case-by-case review.,environment
557,"Negative impact of dams are as follows: in flat basins large dams cause flooding of large tracts of land,",environment
558,destroying local animals and habitats; people have to be displaced causing change in life style and customs about 40 to 80 million people have been displaced physically by dams worldwide; large amounts of plant life,environment
559,are submerged and decay anaerobically; the migratory pattern of river animals like salmon and trout are,environment
560,affected; dams restrict sediments that are responsible for the fertile lands downstream; salt water intrusion,environment
561,into the deltas means that the saline water cannot be used for irrigation; large dams are breeding grounds for,environment
562,"mosquitoes and cause the spread of disease; dams serve as a heat sink, and the water is hotter than the normal",environment
563,river water - this warm water when released into the river downstream can affect animal life [15].,environment

641,Introduction and Overview,environment
642,Environmental sustainability and what it means for us all,environment
643,Environmental sustainability is the ability to maintain the qualities that are valued in,environment
644,the physical environment.,environment
645,"For example, most people want to sustain (maintain):",environment
646,• human life,environment
647,• the capabilities that the natural environment has to maintain the living conditions,environment
648,"for people and other species (eg. clean water and air, a suitable climate)",environment
649,"• the aspects of the environment that produce renewable resources such as water,",environment
650,"timber, fish, solar energy",environment
651,"• the functioning of society, despite non-renewable resource depletion",environment
652,"• the quality of life for all people, the livability and beauty of the environment",environment
653,Threats to these aspects of the environment mean that there is a risk that these things,environment
654,"will not be maintained. For example, the large-scale extraction of non-renewable",environment
655,"resources (such as minerals, coal and oil) or damage done to the natural environment",environment
656,can create threats of serious decline in quality or destruction or extinction.,environment
657,"Traditionally, when environmental problems arise environmental managers work out",environment
658,how to reduce the damage or wastage. But it is not always easy to work out exactly,environment
659,when and where threats will have their effects and often the impacts are hard to,environment
660,reverse. So increasingly environmental managers adopt strategies aimed to prevent,environment
661,damage being done in the first place. A full sustainability program needs to include,environment
662,"actions to prevent threats and impacts from arising, actions to protect the environment",environment
663,"from threats and damage, and restoration to reverse damage already done.",environment
664,Sustainability issues arise wherever there is a risk of difficult or irreversible loss of,environment
665,the things or qualities of the environment that people value. And whenever there are,environment
666,such risks there is a degree of urgency to take action.,environment
667,Environmental sustainability programs include actions to reduce the use of physical,environment
668,"resources, the adoption of a ‘recycle everything/buy recycled’ approach, the use of",environment
669,"renewable rather than depletable resources, the redesign of production processes and",environment
670,"products to eliminate the production of toxic materials, and the protection and",environment
671,restoration of natural habitats and environments valued for their livability or beauty.,environment
672,These sustainability programs need to operate on an adequate scale and need to,environment
673,continue operating reliably for as long as the threats continue.,environment
674,Some of the issues that pose major environmental sustainability problems include:,environment
675,• destruction of the living environments (habitats) of native species,environment
676,• discharge of polluting chemicals and other materials into the environment,environment
677,• emission of greenhouses gases into the atmosphere than can cause climate change,environment
678,• depletion of low cost oil and other fossil fuels,environment
679,ii,environment
680,Some environmental issues are largely of local significance while others have regional,environment
681,or even global relevance.,environment
682,"At the personal or household level, there are a host of actions that people can take to",environment
683,"contribute to environmental sustainability at home, when travelling or accessing",environment
684,"services or goods, at work, or when acting as a community member or citizen or as an",environment
685,investor of personal funds.,environment
686,"Some useful examples are include living close to work where possible and walking,",environment
687,using a bike or using public transport. These are good options to save energy and,environment
688,reduce greenhouse gases. If these options are not possible then using an ultraefficient hybrid petrol/electric vehicle can cut greenhouse gases and petrol,environment
689,consumption by about 50% and cut other toxic pollutants by about 90%.,environment
690,"Buying products made of recycled materials will generally save materials and energy,",environment
691,"cut greenhouse gases and toxic pollution, and reduce impacts on living things in the",environment
692,wild. Installing a water tank and low flow shower can save water.,environment
693,Building or renovating a house using environmental sound design and lower impact,environment
694,materials and 5+ star appliances can make a big impact on all environmental issues.,environment
695,Using food in season or from local sources and organically grown can cut impacts,environment

1,7 common workplace safety hazards ,safety
2,National Safety Council consultants identify what they see repeatedly when auditing worksites ,safety
3,"The National Safety Council has a team of consultants who travel across the country – and the world – to visit worksites and conduct safety audits. But no matter where each team member is, chances are good that he or she will spot one or more of seven common safety hazards. Here, NSC consultants JoAnn Dankert, Namir George and Rachel Harrington identify for Safety+Health the workplace hazards they see over and over again. ",safety
4,1Working at height ,safety
5,"It shouldn’t be a surprise that Dankert, Harrington and George frequently spot hazards associated with working at height. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that falls to a lower level accounted for 14 percent of all fatalities in 2014, and OSHA standards related to scaffolding and ladders are regularly among the most frequently cited violations. ",safety
6,"Dankert, an NSC senior consultant based in Arizona, said hazards associated with working at height can originate from a lack of understanding. Employers may not know they have to provide fall protection, or the fall protection gear may not be worn properly or not hooked up to anything. Some employers don’t even have a written fall protection procedure or process. ",safety
7,"Employers need to identify all locations where fall protection is necessary – as well as where the engineered anchor points are – and train employees and regularly audit the fall protection program, she said. ",safety
8,"Some of those locations may be surprising. Dankert recently visited a manufacturing facility that was expanding and had added to its roof a new 12-foot-tall chiller next to three existing ones. But something was missing. The old equipment had proper fall protection, including swing gates and a railing for when maintenance work is needed, but the new chiller didn’t. ",safety
9,"“The fall hazard was not about doing work and falling off the roof – it was the equipment on top of that roof,” Dankert said. “These are hidden places you don’t go to very often, and you just don’t think about it.” ",safety
10,"Dankert cites this case as an example of the need for safety professionals to have a seat at the table when decisions on design or purchases are made. Their input, she said, can save employers time and money. ",safety
11,"More advice: Buy the correct-sized gear for workers, and keep in mind that although some work environments may have anchor points readily available, other locations may need an engineer to install them. Remind employees to hook to the anchor point when working at height, and keep a close eye on how well personal protective equipment is holding up. Environments with sharp edges, chemicals or welding, for example, can weaken a harness. Regularly inspect gear, and remove damaged PPE from service. ",safety
12,"“Fall protection is like other PPE – it’s not good forever and ever,” Dankert said. ",safety
13,"In some situations, it may be beneficial to forgo using personal fall protection equipment and instead build a platform with standard railings and a swing gate in front of a fixed ladder. Although such a platform costs money, Dankert said, it may be less costly than creating a fall protection plan, buying the PPE, and training and re-training employees. ",safety
14,2Poor housekeeping ,safety
15,"Clutter blocking fire exits, aisles and emergency exits is a housekeeping problem that George, who is based in the United Kingdom as NSC’s manager of international consulting services, sees often. ",safety
16,"Another common hazard? Over-stacking loads on racks in a warehouse that bring them too close to a sprinkler head, which can limit the sprinkler’s efficiency in an emergency. Clutter, leaks or standing water also can contribute to slips, trips and falls. ",safety
17,"Workers shouldn’t wait for housekeeping or sanitation crews to take care of these issues, Dankert said. Instead, they should clean as they go. “Just because it’s a dirty process doesn’t mean you shouldn’t clean up spills,” she said. ",safety
18,"If the clutter or spill requires specialized training to clean up, then employees need to alert their supervisor, who can send in the appropriate staff. Additionally, Dankert recommends setting aside a few minutes at the end of each shift, or on a Friday afternoon, to clean up before leaving for the day. ",safety
19,"When it comes to storage, employers need to make sure appropriate areas are made available, notes Harrington, an NSC senior consultant based in Illinois. Harrington said she often sees electrical rooms used inappropriately for storage, with supplies blocking electrical installations. ",safety
20,"Even if clearance between the stored supplies and the circuit breakers is appropriate, Harrington pointed out, employers need to consider situations that could arise in which someone would need easy access to that room. ",safety
21,"“Think about an emergency where lights are out, something has gone wrong, and it’s full of chairs,” she said. “I wouldn’t recommend storing anything in an electrical room beyond what’s in the use of that room. I wouldn’t recommend it at all.” ",safety

25,3Electrical – Extension cords ,safety
26,Blocked breakers aren’t the only electrical hazard NSC consultants frequently see. Many electrical hazards spotted are related to inappropriate use of extension cords. ,safety
27,"Dankert often witnesses “daisy-chaining” – using multiple extension cords or power strips for a device. At one manufacturing facility Dankert visited, she saw as many as five extension cords chained together. ",safety
28,"“It was almost like Christmas tree lights,” she said. “All you really saw were all these electrical cords everywhere.” ",safety
29,"Because the employer is a developer of prototype equipment, the layout of the manufacturing floor was regularly being changed. And in most other aspects, the employer was conscientious about safety – the extension cords being used were new and heavy-gauge, and the facility was very clean. ",safety
30,"“They were trying to do the right thing, but it also made me think it’s not really temporary,” Dankert said. ",safety
31,"And that’s the point: Although extension cords can be useful for temporarily supplying power for certain operations, the key word is “temporarily.” When a cord is used for several weeks or months, Dankert said, OSHA doesn’t consider the use temporary. This opens the door for a violation. ",safety
32,"Beyond that, extension cords lying on the ground for extended periods of time are a trip hazard. They also can be subject to traffic abuse if run over by forklifts or feet, which can wear down insulation and create shock hazards. When cords are daisy-chained, they can easily overdraw electricity from the circuits, causing the wires to heat up and potentially result in a fire. ",safety
33,"Employers should assess whether extension cords are truly being used for temporary measures – perhaps to power a fan on an especially hot day. In such an event, Dankert said, the cord should be gathered up at the end of the shift and stored. She recommends establishing a system to periodically inspect extension cords, and training employees on that system to ensure the cords stay in good working condition and worn-out cords are placed out of service. ",safety
34,"Workers need to ensure they’re using the right extension cord for the job. Typically, a more expensive cord has a heavier gauge, which allows it to take more power without getting hot. The same applies for using a single power strip to plug in several different devices – the power strip may not be rated for the combined wattage needed for all the high-draw appliances being plugged in. ",safety
35,"If the extension cords are not being used for a temporary fix, employers should consider bringing in an electrician to drop in a line and outlet. ",safety
36,4Forklifts ,safety
37,"What’s a leading cause of forklift-related hazards in the workplace? In George’s experience, it’s when workers feel compelled to work quickly. ",safety
38,"“What dictates their activity is production,” he said. “They’re all under pressure, and when you’re under pressure, they start taking shortcuts.” ",safety
39,"Shortcuts include driving with too large of a load or driving distracted. The end result may be hitting a rack, damaging a wall or product, or even injuring a co-worker. ",safety
40,"How employers react to these occurrences is critical, but their responses often miss the mark, NSC consultants say. George said a common attitude after an incident is to blame the individual and instill discipline. The forklift driver is re-trained, re-tested and then put back into the system. But employers fail to identify the root cause, which often is not enough staff or trucks to manage the current workload. ",safety
41,"Compounding these problems is a lack of maintenance and daily checks of trucks, and failing to segregate vehicles from pedestrians, George said. Trucks should be regularly inspected to ensure they are in proper working order, and employers should create designated walkways. ",safety
42,5Lockout/tagout ,safety
43,"Proper lockout/tagout procedures can help prevent serious injuries, but only if those procedures are followed. ",safety
44,"“A lot of organizations, they’ve got the best procedures in place, but it’s the implementation of the procedures that fails,” George said. ",safety
45,Some examples: ,safety
46,"One employee may go home for the day with his lock on, and the next worker on duty cuts the lock. ",safety
47,Workers may simply use a label on older equipment for which secure lockout is more difficult. ,safety
48,"Instead of installing a chain to lock a valve in place, a wire that can easily be cut may be used. ",safety
49,"Even if all lockout/tagout steps are followed, faulty equipment can still lead to failures. George recalled a case in which an electrician doing rewiring work was shocked. The equipment was locked out, but the instruments he was using to check the system were tampered with and failed to read that the system was live and not isolated. The worker touched a live cable, causing a third-degree burn. ",safety
50,Violation of lockout/tagout procedures often boils down to three reasons: ,safety
51,Complacency ,safety
52,A rush to finish the work ,safety
53,Being unfamiliar with the equipment ,safety
54,"Employers need to train employees on lockout/tagout and ensure they’re qualified to carry out the procedures, George stressed. ",safety
55,6Chemicals ,safety
56,"Chemicals can be expensive, and workers in some industries may never know when they’ll need to use a certain chemical again in the future. But according to Harrington, this kind of thinking can lead to serious hazards. ",safety
57,"“Before you know it, you have all these chemicals no one wants or needs,” she said. “There’ll be literally hundreds of chemicals on the shelves.” ",safety
58,"She added that although it may be easy to overlook a small, 5-gram bottle, those 5 grams can become unstable over time. For example, after a year or so, ether can degrade into explosive peroxide. ",safety
59,"When an organization purchases and uses chemicals, it needs to have a control system, Harrington said. It needs to know what the chemicals are for and why they were ordered. ",safety
60,"OSHA’s Hazard Communication Standard requires facilities to keep an inventory of all products. Mark down the chemical’s expiration date, and use the chemical by that date or dispose of it properly. This is more than just a safety issue, Harrington said – stockpiling a huge cache of unwanted chemicals can be illegal. It also can be very expensive to dispose of large quantities of expired chemicals. ",safety
61,"Another potential hazard is transferring chemicals from one container to another. Even if employees feel comfortable around the chemicals and have worked with them for years, the containers must be labeled as required under the hazcom standard. ",safety
62,7Confined spaces ,safety
63,Confined spaces can present a number of hazards. George said many tragedies involving confined spaces have occurred because an employer didn’t issue a permit or failed to carry out a risk assessment. ,safety
64,"In one scenario George encountered, a confined space’s hazardous atmosphere wasn’t assessed properly because the equipment being used was out of date. A fire broke out. ",safety
65,"“I’ve seen people go inside drains without a permit, and didn’t even know it was a confined space,” he said. “Someone’s gone inside to pick up something and he collapses because the standby person was distracted.” ",safety
66,"If the risk assessment and permit process are done correctly, and all steps are followed, employers won’t have a problem, George said. “Everything is all planned,” he added. “If you don’t plan it correctly, you plan for a disaster.” ",safety
67,Focus on prevention ,safety
68,"The seven hazards presented are by no means an exhaustive list – many other hazards may exist at your worksite, and spotting them requires vigilance. To help identify workplace hazards, NSC consultants recommend focusing on the following areas: ",safety
69,"Training – Workers won’t inherently know they have to do something a certain way, Dankert said. It’s up to each organization to appropriately train employees on safety protocols. This training begins upon hiring the new worker, when an employer provides an introduction to occupational safety and health, including hazard recognition. The training should continue under the specific department in which the new employee will work. Afterward, regular refresher training is necessary. ",safety
70,"Know the purpose of the training, and ensure the appropriate training is given for each individual worker based on his or her needs. After the training, monitor and supervise the workers to check whether they’re applying it appropriately. ",safety
71,“ Spending a little bit of money up front on prevention can save you money on the back end ” ,safety
72,JoAnn Dankert Senior Consultant National Safety Council ,safety
73,"Personal protective equipment – “The use of PPE falls squarely on the role of employers to determine, to provide and to ensure people are wearing it,” Dankert said. ",safety
74,"If employers determine PPE is necessary, they need to select the right sizes and a variety of choices for their staff – and train workers on how to properly put on, wear and take off the gear. Supervisors on the floor should model the behavior they expect from employees by wearing all required PPE. If employees aren’t wearing PPE, Dankert said, employers need to find out why – the gear may be uncomfortable or not performing correctly. ",safety
75,"But providing the right safety equipment isn’t enough. The devices can be misused or neglected. “People are pretty cavalier with their PPE,” Harrington said, adding that employers should ensure gear is placed in its appropriate container and not simply slung over a hook. ",safety
76,"Clearly communicate and reinforce the need for workers to wear PPE by stressing that the equipment protects them from injuries and illnesses, such as losing an eye or developing a respiratory disease. In short, George said, teach “what’s in it for me.” ",safety
77,"Resources – Quite often, small businesses simply don’t have the resources to adequately check their systems for safety. And in many situations, Dankert added, employers may not know what encompasses a safe procedure. ",safety
78,"These employers should reach out and access available resources, many of which are free. Several fire insurance and workers’ compensation insurance carriers offer complimentary inspection programs. OSHA does too, and says employers won’t be penalized if violations are found during a consultation visit. (For more on OSHA’s On-Site Consultation Program, see p. 76) ",safety
79,"Some equipment vendors also may be willing to conduct certain audits, according to Dankert, so ask. Check out free resources on the web – including those from OSHA and the National Safety Council – and search for free, local training. OSHA’s Susan Harwood Training Grant Program routinely provides training in a variety of areas, and its website has free resource materials. ",safety
80,"However, not all resources are free, and employers must be willing to make an investment in certain training or PPE if they want to keep workers safe. “Spending a little bit of money up front on prevention can save you money on the back end,” Dankert said. ",safety
81,"Culture – Many worksites have a “monkey see, monkey do” mentality, according to Harrington. If a supervisor or manager does something in an unsafe manner, other workers will follow suit. ",safety
82,"Instead, organizations should establish a culture in which safety becomes everyone’s responsibility and workers feel comfortable reporting hazardous processes. Leadership sets the tone. ",safety
83,"“If management is committed, and they send a signal to employees about the management of safety to the shop floor or the bottom end of the tree, it cascades that responsibility,” George said. ",safety

92,Difference Between Hazard and Danger ,safety
93,"Warning signs are visible everywhere; on the road, in train stations, and in most public places. Two of the very common words that can be found in these warning signs are “danger” and “hazard.” While both refer to a risk or threat, they are two distinct words. ",safety
94,"A hazard is a condition that presents a risk or threat to the environment as well as an individual’s life, property, or health. It is something that does not exist but is a possibility that an individual will fall victim to an injury or misfortune. It is an unpredictable and yet unknown experience or occurrence that may result in pain, illness, loss, or injury. Examples of hazards are confined spaces, awkward positions, protruding objects, and the presence of stored electrical, chemical, mechanical, and radioactive energy. ",safety
95,"Hazards can be natural such as those posed by volcanoes and tornadoes; man-made such as activities like flying or engaging in extreme sports; or the result of breaking or violating a legal, physical, or moral boundary. A hazard may also be dormant wherein the circumstance still has the potential to be hazardous but still does not affect people, property, or the environment. It can be armed wherein people, property, and the environment are placed in harm’s way. Once a harmful incident has occurred, it is an active hazard and would create an emergency situation. ",safety
96,The term comes from the Old French word “hasard” which means “dice game” which is derived from the Arabic “az-zahr” which means “the gaming die.” ,safety
97,"On the other hand, the term “danger” comes from the Middle English word “daunger” which means “power” or “peril” which is derived from the Old French “dangier” from the Latin “dominus” which means “master.” In the English language it came to refer to the power to cause harm. It is a situation where an individual is susceptible to harm or one wherein he is exposed or put at risk. It may or may not be something that is clearly evident or known. A dangerous incident can be serious, but it can also be as mild as the danger of cutting your finger when slicing onions. ",safety
98,“Hazard” is usually used to refer to something that is extremely serious or very damaging. It is used in warning signs to indicate the severity of the situation. It is used to refer to dangers that are bigger and more serious while “danger” is used to generally refer to risky situations whether big or small. ,safety
99,Summary: ,safety
100,"1.A hazard is a condition that presents a threat to an individual, property, or the environment while danger is a situation where an individual is put at risk or is susceptible to a possible hazard. 2.A hazard is usually used to refer to risky situations that are very serious or life-threatening while danger is used in a more general way to refer to risky situations that may cause slight or serious damage. 3.The word “hazard” comes from the Arabic word “az-zahr” while the word “danger” comes from the Latin word “dominus.” ",safety

137,What is a hazard? ,safety
138,"The meaning of the word hazard can be confusing. Often dictionaries do not give specific definitions or combine it with the term ""risk"". For example, one dictionary defines hazard as ""a danger or risk"" which helps explain why many people use the terms interchangeably. ",safety
139,There are many definitions for hazard but the most common definition when talking about workplace health and safety is: ,safety
140,"A hazard is any source of potential damage, harm or adverse health effects on something or someone. ",safety
141,"The CSA Z1002 Standard ""Occupational health and safety - Hazard identification and elimination and risk assessment and control"" uses the following terms: ",safety
142,Harm - physical injury or damage to health. ,safety
143,Hazard - a potential source of harm to a worker. ,safety
144,"Basically, a hazard is the potential for harm or an adverse effect (for example, to people as health effects, to organizations as property or equipment losses, or to the environment). ",safety
145,"Sometimes the resulting harm is referred to as the hazard instead of the actual source of the hazard. For example, the disease tuberculosis (TB) might be called a ""hazard"" by some but, in general, the TB-causing bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) would be considered the ""hazard"" or ""hazardous biological agent"".

147,"Workplace hazards can come from a wide range of sources. General examples include any substance, material, process, practice, etc. that has the ability to cause harm or adverse health effect to a person or property. See Table 1. ",safety
148,Workplace hazards also include practices or conditions that release uncontrolled energy like: ,safety
149,"an object that could fall from a height (potential or gravitational energy), ",safety
150,"a run-away chemical reaction (chemical energy), ",safety
151,"the release of compressed gas or steam (pressure; high temperature), ",safety
152,"entanglement of hair or clothing in rotating equipment (kinetic energy), or ",safety
153,contact with electrodes of a battery or capacitor (electrical energy). ,safety
154,What is risk? ,safety
155,"Risk is the chance or probability that a person will be harmed or experience an adverse health effect if exposed to a hazard. It may also apply to situations with property or equipment loss, or harmful effects on the environment. ",safety
156,"The CSA Z1002 Standard ""Occupational health and safety - Hazard identification and elimination and risk assessment and control"" uses the following terms: ",safety
157,Risk – the combination of the likelihood of the occurrence of a harm and the severity of that harm. ,safety
158,"Likelihood – the chance of something happening. Note: In risk assessment terminology, the word “likelihood” is used to refer to the chance of something happening, whether defined, measured, or determined objectively or subjectively, qualitatively or quantitatively, and described using general terms or mathematically (e.g., a probability or a frequency over a given time period). ",safety
159,For example: the risk of developing cancer from smoking cigarettes could be expressed as: ,safety
160,"""cigarette smokers are 12 times (for example) more likely to die of lung cancer than non-smokers"", or ",safety
161,"""the number per 100,000 smokers who will develop lung cancer"" (actual number depends on factors such as their age and how many years they have been smoking). These risks are expressed as a probability or likelihood of developing a disease or getting injured, whereas hazard refers to the agent responsible (i.e. smoking). ",safety
162,Factors that influence the degree or likelihood of risk are: ,safety
163,"the nature of the exposure: how much a person is exposed to a hazardous thing or condition (e.g., several times a day or once a year), ",safety
164,"how the person is exposed (e.g., breathing in a vapour, skin contact), and ",safety
165,"the severity of the effect. For example, one substance may cause skin cancer, while another may cause skin irritation. Cancer is a much more serious effect than irritation. ",safety
166,What is a risk assessment? ,safety
167,Risk assessment is the process where you: ,safety
168,Identify hazards and risk factors that have the potential to cause harm (hazard identification). ,safety
169,"Analyze and evaluate the risk associated with that hazard (risk analysis, and risk evaluation). ",safety
170,"Determine appropriate ways to eliminate the hazard, or control the risk when the hazard cannot be eliminated (risk control). ",safety
171,The OSH Answers document on Risk Assessment has details on how to conduct an assessment and establish priorities. ,safety
172,What is an adverse health effect? ,safety
173,"A general definition of adverse health effect is ""any change in body function or the structures of cells that can lead to disease or health problems"". ",safety
174,Adverse health effects include: ,safety
175,"bodily injury, ",safety
176,"disease, ",safety
177,"change in the way the body functions, grows, or develops, ",safety
178,"effects on a developing fetus (teratogenic effects, fetotoxic effects), ",safety
179,"effects on children, grandchildren, etc. (inheritable genetic effects) ",safety
180,"decrease in life span, ",safety
181,"change in mental condition resulting from stress, traumatic experiences, exposure to solvents, and so on, and ",safety
182,effects on the ability to accommodate additional stress. ,safety
183,"Will exposure to hazards in the workplace always cause injury, illness or other adverse health effects? ",safety
184,"Not necessarily. To answer this question, you need to know: ",safety
185,"what hazards are present, ",safety
186,"how a person is exposed (route of exposure, as well as how often and how much exposure occurred), ",safety
187,"what kind of effect could result from the specific exposure a person experienced, ",safety
188,"the risk (or likelihood) that exposure to a hazardous thing or condition would cause an injury, or disease or some incidence causing damage, and ",safety
189,"how severe would the damage, injury or harm (adverse health effect) be from the exposure. ",safety
190,"The effects can be acute, meaning that the injury or harm can occur or be felt as soon as a person comes in contact with the hazardous agent (e.g., a splash of acid in a person's eyes). Some responses may be chronic (delayed). For example, exposure to poison ivy may cause red swelling on the skin two to six hours after contact with the plant. On the other hand, longer delays are possible: mesothelioma, a kind of cancer in the lining of the lung cavity, can develop 20 years or more after exposure to asbestos. ",safety
191,"Once the hazard is removed or eliminated, the effects may be reversible or irreversible (permanent). For example, a hazard may cause an injury that can heal completely (reversible) or result in an untreatable disease (irreversible). ",safety
192,What types of hazards are there? ,safety
193,A common way to classify hazards is by category: ,safety
194,"biological - bacteria, viruses, insects, plants, birds, animals, and humans, etc., ",safety
195,"chemical - depends on the physical, chemical and toxic properties of the chemical, ",safety
196,"ergonomic - repetitive movements, improper set up of workstation, etc., ",safety
197,"physical - radiation, magnetic fields, pressure extremes (high pressure or vacuum), noise, etc., ",safety
198,"psychosocial - stress, violence, etc., ",safety
199,"safety - slipping/tripping hazards, inappropriate machine guarding, equipment malfunctions or breakdowns. ",safety

208,A Hazard Brings the Potential of Danger ,safety
209,"We live in a hazard rich world, but don’t really give it much thought because safety controls are put in place to protect us. ",safety
210,A safety hazard is an unsafe condition or behaviour that could lead to injury. A safety control is the device in place to protect us from risk of injury. ,safety
211,"As long as a control measure is in place, danger need not enter into the picture. ",safety
212,For example: ,safety
213,"For the hazard of moving parts on equipment, we may use guards as the control measure ",safety
214,"For the hazard of falling from a high level, we may use a fall arrest system as the control measure ",safety
215,"You get the idea. As long as the hazard has been identified and a control is in place to protect us from the identified risk, no danger need exist. ",safety
216,Training employees to recognize hazards in their workplace is one of your best investments in safety. ,safety
217,Hazard Assessments ,safety
218,"Safety inspections must be done on a regular basis to identify dangers, which are exposed hazards without controls in place. To ensure you’re recognizing all potential hazards, a layered approach for safety audits is suggested. In this way different people, groups or team members regularly review different areas. It’s amazing what a fresh set of eyes will uncover. ",safety
219,"Performing regularly scheduled inspections to identify hazards is an important element in any safety management system. Have set intervals when safety inspections are conducted, and record all findings. When a hazard is discovered, an assessment must be performed based on the risk exposure and severity. ",safety
220,"Each identified hazard should undergo a risk assessment to assign a level of potential danger. For example, when conducting a safety walk of a work area, and where twelve hazards without proper control measures are identified, a risk assessment would give each hazard a rating and determine which hazards presented the highest potential danger to workers. Typically, these should be addressed first. ",safety
221,"Severity - How severe could the injury be from the identified hazard? It could be as small as a pinched finger or, as severe as the death of one or more workers. ",safety
222,"Exposure - How often is the worker exposed to the potential hazard? It could be extremely low, e.g. once per month for few seconds, or extremely high, e.g. for an entire shift. An example of this, common in many factories, is exposure to excessive noise. ",safety
223,Job Activity and Hazard Assessments ,safety
224,Another valuable activity for searching out potential occupational health and safety hazards is to review all work tasks associated with job positions. ,safety
225,"Standard work procedures are like a “Play Book” which shows all work tasks an employee will perform as part of their job. It also shows the safest, most efficient way to perform those tasks. The onus is on employers to review each task. ",safety
226,"As improvements are made, the standard work instructions are updated. Thus, safety is built into all work instructions. ",safety
227,Black and White ,safety
228,"Performing structured safety inspections and walkabouts, to assess identified hazards and control measures, ensures a practical approach for identifying potential danger. ",safety
229,These activities are the foundation for the control of workplace hazards. Safety walks and standard work instructions are a proactive approach to safety. They identify all health and safety concerns in black and white for employees. ,safety
230,"It does not matter if your work environment is a factory, construction site, or a restaurant; identifying hazards is a key element of an OHS management system. The time and attention will result in fewer accidents and higher worker morale. The more time invested in these activities, the less time will be needed to investigate accidents. ",safety

233,6 Common Industrial Fan Safety Hazards ,safety
234,Be Aware of the Hazards with Industrial Fans ,safety
235,"Here at Moffitt we often receive questions about staying safe around industrial fans. Many are concerned with protecting workers from contacting rotating blades on our fan equipment and are interested in purchasing guards or other protection. This is of course a very real danger, but there are also other industrial fan safety hazards associated with working with industrial fan equipment. As safety is always our first priority, we thought we’d take a minute to focus on the major hazards associated with fans. ",safety
236,"For over 50 years Moffitt has sold, manufactured, and installed multiple types of fans. We sell everything from small axial units to very large hooded supply/exhaust units to move large volumes of air. ",safety
237,Every fan has at least two things in common: ,safety
238,A rotating driven component (Fan) ,safety
239,A rotating driver component (Motor) ,safety
240,"Often there will also be belts and sheaves (pulleys) to connect the two and sometimes the fan will be direct-driven and no belts are required. Despite these variations, those are the two things that every fan has in common. Additionally, every fan has the same specific industrial fan safety hazards. They are as follows: ",safety
241,"Contact with rotating blades – An operating fan poses a significant risk of injury by contact with the propeller, and must be treated with vigilance and care. Indirect contact can also occur with blowing dust/dirt. This is particularly hazardous to eyes and respiratory system. ",safety
242,Lock out and tag out the unit when working on fan equipment. Test it by operating the starter to ensure the unit is de-energized. Do this before removing any guards. ,safety
243,"Wind blowing through the fan housing can cause the propeller to rotate (windmill), sometimes at high speed. A large propeller has significant mass and can knock you off your feet. Make sure you maintain a safe proximity from the fan wheel and always be sure to secure the propeller before entering the fan housing area. ",safety
244,"Pinch points in belts/sheaves – Even if the fan wheel is rotating slowly, without power, a significant mechanical advantage is developed at the sheaves. This is especially true with large fans. A finger caught between the sheave and the rotating belt could result in serious injury or digit loss. ",safety
245,"Fan Blade/component failure during initial start up – Fan failure on startup is generally a rare event, but sometimes it happens. Fans travel long distances on flatbed trailers. They encounter vibration, bumps, and weather. It is not uncommon to find loose components on arrival at the job site so thorough inspection of each fan on arrival is important. Be sure to. ",safety
246,Look for loose/missing components and damage ,safety
247,Correct all discrepancies before starting the fan. ,safety
248,"Listen for any unusual noises, squeaks, squeals, hum, or rubbing. ",safety
249,Make sure the blade does not contact any part of the spinning area. This is cause for immediate unit rejection. Correct this problem immediately as running in this condition will result in very quick blade failure. ,safety
250,"Look for blade wobble or tracking problems. “Bump” each fan before committing to a full power run. “Bump” means applying a short burst of power to start the fan wheel rotating, then immediately de-energizing the unit. ",safety
251,"Material/debris entering fan – Certain fans are more susceptible to the dangers of an object entering the propeller path, but it can happen to any type of fan. Working over an operating upblast roof exhauster with hand tools is a recipe for disaster. Fan wheels will fail this when material contacts blades and unfortunately this type of material is everywhere. For instance, fans often ship with dunnage inside to secure components. Remove dunnage before start-up to avoid problems later. ",safety
252,Spinning fans are very powerful. A full brim phenolic hard can be reduced to fibers if inadvertently left in the fan housing and the unit is energized. ,safety
253,"Contact with hot motor surface – Don’t forget that even when de-energized and locked out, fan motors have significant mass. They will retain heat for extended periods. 220 degree F and higher temperatures are possible. Let the unit have a cool down period before starting work. ",safety
254,"Guards – Guards keep workers from directly experiencing the items above. However, even a guard can become an industrial fan safety hazard. ",safety
255,"Guards should be in good shape and properly secured to the fan housing. Use the correct number of sheet metal screws. If unsecured, guards can fall into the fan. ",safety
256,Be careful when removing guards. They tend to be large and not very rigid. This can result in loss of balance when working on elevated surfaces and ladders. ,safety
257,Guards often contain sharp edges from expanded metal and other screen materials. Wear gloves when handling screens. ,safety
258,The following is an excerpt from OHSA 1910.212 regarding the required use of guards: ,safety
259,"1910.212(a)(3)(ii) The point of operation of machines whose operation exposes an employee to injury, shall be guarded. The guarding device shall be in conformity with any appropriate standards, therefore, or, in the absence of applicable specific standards, shall be so designed and constructed as to prevent the operator from having any part of his body in the danger zone during the operating cycle. ",safety
260,"1910.212(a)(5) Exposure of blades. When the periphery of the blades of a fan is less than seven (7) feet above the floor or working level, the blades shall be guarded. The guard shall have openings no larger than one-half (1/2) inch. As you can see, OSHA regulations stipulate that a ½” guard is required to be used on a fan, unless it is located seven feet or greater above the work floor/level, and it does not expose an employee to injury. Since it is not possible to anticipate if direct exposure to fans via lifts, ladders, etc. will occur, it is good practice to include guards with each and every fan. ",safety

It was adopted by the Joint ILO/WHO Committee on Occupational Health at its first session in 1950 and revised at its twelfth session in 1995. The definition reads: ",safety
271,"The main focus in occupational health is on three different objectives: (i) the maintenance and promotion of workers’ health and working capacity; (ii) the improvement of working environment and work to become conducive to safety and health and (iii) development of work organizations and working cultures in a direction which supports health and safety at work and in doing so also promotes a positive social climate and smooth operation and may enhance productivity of the undertakings. The concept of working culture is intended in this context to mean a reflection of the essential value systems adopted by the undertaking concerned.

277,"In the United Kingdom, the Factory Acts of the early nineteenth century (from 1802 onwards) arose out of concerns about the poor health of children working in cotton mills: the Act of 1833 created a dedicated professional Factory Inspectorate.[9] :41 The initial remit of the Inspectorate was to police restrictions on the working hours in the textile industry of children and young persons (introduced to prevent chronic overwork, identified as leading directly to ill-health and deformation, and indirectly to a high accident rate). However, on the urging of the Factory Inspectorate, a further Act in 1844 giving similar restrictions on working hours for women in the textile industry introduced a requirement for machinery guarding (but only in the textile industry, and only in areas that might be accessed by women or children).[9] :85 ",safety
278,"In 1840 a Royal Commission published its findings on the state of conditions for the workers of the mining industry that documented the appallingly dangerous environment that they had to work in and the high frequency of accidents. The commission sparked public outrage which resulted in the Mines Act of 1842. The act set up an inspectorate for mines and collieries which resulted in many prosecutions and safety improvements, and by 1850, inspectors were able to enter and inspect premises at their discretion.[10] ",safety

These include but are not limited to, ""chemicals, biological agents, physical factors, adverse ergonomic conditions, allergens, a complex network of safety risks,"" and a broad range of psychosocial risk factors.[12] Personal protective equipment can help protect against many of these hazards.[13] ",safety
281,"Physical hazards affect many people in the workplace. Occupational hearing loss is the most common work-related injury in the United States, with 22 million workers exposed to hazardous noise levels at work and an estimated $242 million spent annually on worker's compensation for hearing loss disability.[14] Falls are also a common cause of occupational injuries and fatalities, especially in construction, extraction, transportation, healthcare, and building cleaning and maintenance.[15] Machines have moving parts, sharp edges, hot surfaces and other hazards with the potential to crush, burn, cut, shear, stab or otherwise strike or wound workers if used unsafely.[16] ",safety
282,"Biological hazards (biohazards) include infectious microorganisms such as viruses and toxins produced by those organisms such as anthrax. Biohazards affect workers in many industries; influenza, for example, affects a broad population of workers.[17] Outdoor workers, including farmers, landscapers, and construction workers, risk exposure to numerous biohazards, including animal bites and stings,[18][19][20] urushiol from poisonous plants,[21] and diseases transmitted through animals such as the West Nile virus and Lyme disease.[22][23] Health care workers, including veterinary health workers, risk exposure to blood-borne pathogens and various infectious diseases,[24][25] especially those that are emerging.[26] ",safety
283,"Dangerous chemicals can pose a chemical hazard in the workplace. There are many classifications of hazardous chemicals, including neurotoxins, immune agents, dermatologic agents, carcinogens, reproductive toxins, systemic toxins, asthmagens, pneumoconiotic agents, and sensitizers.[27] Authorities such as regulatory agencies set occupational exposure limits to mitigate the risk of chemical hazards.[28] An international effort is investigating the health effects of mixtures of chemicals. There is some evidence that certain chemicals are harmful at lower levels when mixed with one or more other chemicals. This may be particularly important in causing cancer.[29] ",safety
284,"Psychosocial hazards include risks to the mental and emotional well-being of workers, such as feelings of job insecurity, long work hours, and poor work-life balance.[30] A recent Cochrane review - using moderate quality evidence - related that the addition of work-directed interventions for depressed workers receiving clinical interventions reduces the number of lost work days as compared to clinical interventions alone.[31] This review also demonstrated that the addition of cognitive behavioral therapy to primary or occupational care and the addition of a ""structured telephone outreach and care management program"" to usual care are both effective at reducing sick leave days.[31] ",safety
285,"Specific occupational safety and health risk factors vary depending on the specific sector and industry. Construction workers might be particularly at risk of falls, for instance, whereas fishermen might be particularly at risk of drowning. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics identifies the fishing, aviation, lumber, metalworking, agriculture, mining and transportation industries as among some of the more dangerous for workers.[32] Similarly psychosocial risks such as workplace violence are more pronounced for certain occupational groups such as health care employees, police, correctional officers and teachers.[33] ",safety

287,"Construction is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world, incurring more occupational fatalities than any other sector in both the United States and in the European Union.[34][35] In 2009, the fatal occupational injury rate among construction workers in the United States was nearly three times that for all workers.[34] Falls are one of the most common causes of fatal and non-fatal injuries among construction workers.[34] Proper safety equipment such as harnesses and guardrails and procedures such as securing ladders and inspecting scaffolding can curtail the risk of occupational injuries in the construction industry.[36] Due to the fact that accidents may have disastrous consequences for employees as well as organizations, it is of utmost importance to ensure health and safety of workers and compliance with HSE construction requirements. Health and safety legislation in the construction industry involves many rules and regulations. For example, the role of the Construction Design Management (CDM) Coordinator as a requirement has been aimed at improving health and safety on-site.[37] ",safety
288,"The 2010 National Health Interview Survey Occupational Health Supplement (NHIS-OHS) identified work organization factors and occupational psychosocial and chemical/physical exposures which may increase some health risks.

Prevalence rates for exposure to physical/chemical hazards were especially high for the construction sector. Among nonsmoking workers, 24% of construction workers were exposed to secondhand smoke while only 10% of all U.S. workers were exposed. Other physical/chemical hazards with high prevalence rates in the construction industry were frequently working outdoors (73%) and frequent exposure to vapors, gas, dust, or fumes (51%).[38] ",safety
289,"Agriculture workers are often at risk of work-related injuries, lung disease, noise-induced hearing loss, skin disease, as well as certain cancers related to chemical use or prolonged sun exposure. On industrialized farms, injuries frequently involve the use of agricultural machinery. The most common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in the United States is tractor rollovers, which can be prevented by the use of roll over protection structures which limit the risk of injury in case a tractor rolls over.[39] Pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can also be hazardous to worker health,[40] and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illnesses or birth defects.[41] As an industry in which families, including children, commonly work alongside their families, agriculture is a common source of occupational injuries and illnesses among younger workers.[42] Common causes of fatal injuries among young farm worker include drowning, machinery and motor vehicle-related accidents.[43] ",safety

Hospitals and other healthcare facilities can upload the occupational injury data they already collect to the secure database for analysis and benchmarking with other de-identified facilities. NIOSH works with OHSN participants in identifying and implementing timely and targeted interventions. OHSN modules currently focus on three high risk and preventable events that can lead to injuries or musculoskeletal disorders among healthcare personnel: musculoskeletal injuries from patient handling activities;[51] slips, trips, and falls; and workplace violence. OHSN enrollment is open to all healthcare facilities. ",safety

They did not spend money on equipment modernization, and the share of harmful workplaces increased.[67] The state did not interfere in this, and sometimes it helped employers.[citation needed] At first, the process of growth was slow - due to the fact that in the 1990s this was compensated by mass de-industrialization (factories with foundries and other harmful types of production were closed).[citation needed] In the 2000s, this method of restraining the growth of the share of harmful workplaces was exhausted. Therefore, in 2010s the Ministry of Labor adopted the Federal law 426-FZ, which equated the issuance of personal protective equipment to the employee to real improvement of working conditions; and the Ministry of Health made significant changes in the methods of risk assessment in the workplace.[68] This explains the ""decline"" in the proportion of workers working in harmful conditions after 2014 - it happened not in practice, but only on paper.[citation needed] ",safety

OHSAS 18000 comprised two parts, OHSAS 18001 and 18002 and was developed by a selection of leading trade bodies, international standards and certification bodies to address a gap where no third-party certifiable international standard existed.[citation needed] It was intended to integrate with ISO 9001 and ISO 14001.[74] ",safety

310,"Occupational safety and health practice vary among nations with different approaches to legislation, regulation, enforcement, and incentives for compliance. In the EU, for example, some member states promote OSH by providing public monies as subsidies, grants or financing, while others have created tax system incentives for OSH investments. A third group of EU member states has experimented with using workplace accident insurance premium discounts for companies or organisations with strong OSH records.[75] ",safety

Western Australia intends to adopt a moderated version of the model approach and Victoria has retained its own regime, although the Model WHS laws themselves drew heavily on the Victoria approach. ",safety
312,"In Canada, workers are covered by provincial or federal labour codes depending on the sector in which they work. Workers covered by federal legislation (including those in mining, transportation, and federal employment) are covered by the Canada Labour Code; all other workers are covered by the health and safety legislation of the province in which they work. The Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS), an agency of the Government of Canada, was created in 1966 by an Act of Parliament. The act was based on the belief that all Canadians had ""...a fundamental right to a healthy and safe working environment."" CCOHS is mandated to promote safe and healthy workplaces to help prevent work-related injuries and illnesses. The CCOHS maintains a useful (partial) list of OSH regulations for Canada and its provinces.[78] ",safety
313,"In the European Union, member states have enforcing authorities to ensure that the basic legal requirements relating to occupational health and safety are met. In many EU countries, there is strong cooperation between employer and worker organisations (e.g. unions) to ensure good OSH performance as it is recognized this has benefits for both the worker (through maintenance of health) and the enterprise (through improved productivity and quality). In 1996, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work was founded. ",safety
314,Member states of the European Union have all transposed into their national legislation a series of directives that establish minimum standards on occupational health and safety. These directives (of which there are about 20 on a variety of topics) follow a similar structure requiring the employer to assess the workplace risks and put in place preventive measures based on a hierarchy of control. This hierarchy starts with elimination of the hazard and ends with personal protective equipment. ,safety
315,"However, certain EU member states admit to having lacking quality control in occupational safety services, to situations in which risk analysis takes place without any on-site workplace visits and to insufficient implementation of certain EU OSH directives. Based on this, it is hardly surprising that the total societal costs of work-related health problems and accidents vary from 2.6% to 3.8% of GNP between the EU member states.[80] ",safety
316,"In Denmark, occupational safety and health is regulated by the Danish Act on Working Environment and cooperation at the workplace.[81] The Danish Working Environment Authority carries out inspections of companies, draws up more detailed rules on health and safety at work and provides information on health and safety at work.[82] The result of each inspection is made public on the web pages of the Danish Working Environment Authority so that the general public, current and prospective employees, customers and other stakeholders can inform themselves about whether a given organization has passed the inspection, should they wish to do so.[83] ",safety

319,"In the UK, health and safety legislation is drawn up and enforced by the Health and Safety Executive and local authorities (the local council) under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974[87][88] (HASAWA). HASAWA introduced (section 2) a general duty on an employer to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare at work of all his employees; with the intention of giving a legal framework supporting 'codes of practice' not in themselves having legal force but establishing a strong presumption as to what was reasonably practicable (deviations from them could be justified by appropriate risk assessment). The previous reliance on detailed prescriptive rule-setting was seen as having failed to respond rapidly enough to technological change, leaving new technologies potentially un-regulated or inappropriately regulated.[89][90] HSE has continued to make some regulations giving absolute duties (where something must be done with no 'reasonable practicability' test) but in the UK the regulatory trend is away from prescriptive rules, and towards 'goal setting' and risk assessment. Recent major changes to the laws governing asbestos and fire safety management embrace the concept of risk assessment. The other key aspect of the UK legislation is a statutory mechanism for worker involvement through elected health and safety representatives and health and safety committees. This followed a similar approach in Scandinavia, and that approach has since been adopted in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Malaysia, for example. ",safety
320,"For the UK, the government organisation dealing with occupational health has been the Employment Medical Advisory Service but in 2014 a new occupational health organisation - the Health and Work Service - was created to provide advice and assistance to employers in order to get back to work employees on long-term sick-leave.[91] The service, funded by government, will offer medical assessments and treatment plans, on a voluntary basis, to people on long-term absence from their employer; in return, the government will no longer foot the bill for Statutory Sick Pay provided by the employer to the individual.

Unfortunately it has not worked out that way. There are currently 26 approved state plans (4 cover only public employees)[52] and no other states want to participate. OSHA manages the plan in the states not participating.[52] ",safety

Similar to the findings of the ENHSPO survey conducted in Australia, the Institute of Occupational Medicine in the UK found that there is a need to put greater emphasis on work-related illness in the UK.[119] In contrast, in Australia and the US, a major responsibility of the OHS professional is to keep company directors and managers aware of the issues that they face in regards to occupational health and safety principles and legislation. However, in some other areas of Europe, it is precisely this which has been lacking: “Nearly half of senior managers and company directors do not have an up-to-date understanding of their health and safety-related duties and responsibilities.”[120] ",safety

372,A hazard is something that can cause harm if not controlled. ,safety
373,The outcome is the harm that results from an uncontrolled hazard. ,safety
374,A risk is a combination of the probability that a particular outcome will occur and the severity of the harm involved.[121] ,safety
375,"“Hazard”, “risk”, and “outcome” are used in other fields to describe e.g. environmental damage, or damage to equipment. However, in the context of OSH, “harm” generally describes the direct or indirect degradation, temporary or permanent, of the physical, mental, or social well-being of workers. For example, repetitively carrying out manual handling of heavy objects is a hazard. The outcome could be a musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) or an acute back or joint injury. The risk can be expressed numerically (e.g. a 0.5 or 50/50 chance of the outcome occurring during a year), in relative terms (e.g. ""high/medium/low""), or with a multi-dimensional classification scheme (e.g. situation-specific risks).[citation needed] ",safety
376,"Hazard identification or assessment is an important step in the overall risk assessment and risk management process. It is where individual work hazards are identified, assessed and controlled/eliminated as close to source (location of the hazard) as reasonably as possible. As technology, resources, social expectation or regulatory requirements change, hazard analysis focuses controls more closely toward the source of the hazard. Thus hazard control is a dynamic program of prevention. Hazard based programs also have the advantage of not assigning or implying there are ""acceptable risks"" in the workplace.[122] A hazard-based program may not be able to eliminate all risks, but neither does it accept ""satisfactory"" – but still risky – outcomes. And as those who calculate and manage the risk are usually managers while those exposed to the risks are a different group, workers, a hazard-based approach can by-pass conflict inherent in a risk-based approach.[citation needed] ",safety
377,"The information that needs to be gathered from sources should apply to the specific type of work from which the hazards can come from. As mentioned previously, examples of these sources include interviews with people who have worked in the field of the hazard, history and analysis of past incidents, and official reports of work and the hazards encountered. Of these, the personnel interviews may be the most critical in identifying undocumented practices, events, releases, hazards and other relevant information. Once the information is gathered from a collection of sources, it is recommended for these to be digitally archived (to allow for quick searching) and to have a physical set of the same information in order for it to be more accessible. One innovative way to display the complex historical hazard information is with a historical hazards identification map, which distills the hazard information into an easy to use graphical format. ",safety
378,Modern occupational safety and health legislation usually demands that a risk assessment be carried out prior to making an intervention. It should be kept in mind that risk management requires risk to be managed to a level which is as low as is reasonably practical.[citation needed] ,safety

380,Identify the hazards ,safety
381,Identify all affected by the hazard and how ,safety

384,"The calculation of risk is based on the likelihood or probability of the harm being realized and the severity of the consequences. This can be expressed mathematically as a quantitative assessment (by assigning low, medium and high likelihood and severity with integers and multiplying them to obtain a risk factor), or qualitatively as a description of the circumstances by which the harm could arise.[citation needed] ",safety
385,"The assessment should be recorded and reviewed periodically and whenever there is a significant change to work practices. The assessment should include practical recommendations to control the risk. Once recommended controls are implemented, the risk should be re-calculated to determine if it has been lowered to an acceptable level. Generally speaking, newly introduced controls should lower risk by one level, i.e., from high to medium or from medium to low.[123] ",safety
386,"On an international scale, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) have begun focusing on labour environments in developing nations with projects such as Healthy Cities.[124] Many of these developing countries are stuck in a situation in which their relative lack of resources to invest in OSH leads to increased costs due to work-related illnesses and accidents. The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work states indicates that nations having less developed OSH systems spend a higher fraction of their gross national product on job-related injuries and illness[125] – taking resources away from more productive activities. The ILO estimates that work-related illness and accidents cost up to 10% of GDP in Latin America, compared with just 2.6% to 3.8% in the EU.""[126] There is continued use of asbestos, a notorious hazard, in some developing countries.

A Swiss survey of one hundred thirty eight companies using or producing nanoparticulate matter in 2006 resulted in forty completed questionnaires. Sixty five per cent of respondent companies stated they did not have a formal risk assessment process for dealing with nanoparticulate matter.[127] Nanotechnology already presents new issues for OSH professionals that will only become more difficult as nanostructures become more complex. The size of the particles renders most containment and personal protective equipment ineffective. The toxicology values for macro sized industrial substances are rendered inaccurate due to the unique nature of nanoparticulate matter. As nanoparticulate matter decreases in size its relative surface area increases dramatically, increasing any catalytic effect or chemical reactivity substantially versus the known value for the macro substance. This presents a new set of challenges in the near future to rethink contemporary measures to safeguard the health and welfare of employees against a nanoparticulate substance that most conventional controls have not been designed to manage.[128] ",safety

390,"There are multiple levels of training applicable to the field of occupational safety and health (OSH). Programs range from individual non-credit certificates, focusing on specific areas of concern, to full doctoral programs. The University of Southern California was one of the first schools in the US to offer a Ph.D. program focusing on the field. Further, multiple master's degree programs exist, such as that of the Indiana State University who offer a master of science (MS) and a master of arts (MA) in OSH. Graduate programs are designed to train educators, as well as, high-level practitioners. Many OSH generalists focus on undergraduate studies; programs within schools, such as that of the University of North Carolina's online Bachelor of Science in Environmental Health and Safety, fill a large majority of hygienist needs. However, smaller companies often do not have full-time safety specialists on staff, thus, they appoint a current employee to the responsibility. Individuals finding themselves in positions such as these, or for those enhancing marketability in the job-search and promotion arena, may seek out a credit certificate program. For example, the University of Connecticut's online OSH Certificate,[130] provides students familiarity with overarching concepts through a 15-credit (5-course) program. Programs such as these are often adequate tools in building a strong educational platform for new safety managers with a minimal outlay of time and money. Further, most hygienists seek certification by organizations which train in specific areas of concentration, focusing on isolated workplace hazards. The American Society for Safety Engineers (ASSE), American Board of Industrial Hygiene (ABIH), and American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) offer individual certificates on many different subjects from forklift operation to waste disposal and are the chief facilitators of continuing education in the OSH sector. In the U.S. the training of safety professionals is supported by National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health through their NIOSH Education and Research Centers. In Australia, training in OSH is available at the vocational education and training level, and at university undergraduate and postgraduate level. Such university courses may be accredited by an Accreditation Board of the Safety Institute of Australia.

519,"Science Laboratory Safety Symbols and Hazard Signs, Meanings ",safety
520,"Science Laboratory Safety Symbols and Hazard Signs, Meanings ",safety
521,"In order to maintain a safe workplace and avoid accidents, lab safety symbols and signs need to be posted throughout the workplace ",safety
522,"Depending upon the scientific research being conducted, a lab can be filled with dangerous chemicals, radioactive substances, biological specimens, sharp instruments, breakable glassware, and flammable objects. Thus, those working in labs need to be keenly aware of the many dangers associated with these items. In order to maintain a safe workplace and avoid accidents, lab safety symbols and signs need to be posted throughout the workplace. Researchers, staff, and visitors should note and understand the hazard communication information on the laboratory safety signs, including specific hazardous agents (biological, chemical, radiological), physical hazards (lasers, magnetic fields) present in the space, stated precautions (no food or drink allowed), and required personal protective equipment (lab coats, eye protection, gloves, etc.). ",safety
523,The following laboratory safety symbols warn of possible dangers in the laboratory to help lab professionals keep safe and informed. ,safety
524,Physical Safety Symbols ,safety
525,1. Gloves Required ,safety
526,"Look for the gloves safety symbol to identify when hand protection should be worn for handling hazardous materials, even in small quantities. It is important to choose the appropriate type of glove for the hazard present, such as chemical resistant gloves, heat resistant gloves, etc. Be aware that no chemical resistant glove protects against all chemical hazards. Read the Material Safety Data Sheet for guidance on the appropriate type of glove to wear, or consult with lab supply distributors for glove vs. chemical comparison charts when choosing chemically resistant gloves. Be aware that some materials may cause reactions in some workers such as allergies to latex. Make sure the gloves fit properly. ",safety
527,2. Boots Required ,safety
528,"The laboratory boots required safety symbol indicates when street shoes are not adequate for certain lab-related tasks. Chemical resistant overshoes or boots should be used to avoid possible exposure to corrosive chemicals or large quantities of solvents or water that might penetrate normal footwear. Leather shoes tend to absorb chemicals and may have to be discarded if contaminated with a hazardous material. In a lab, dropping a beaker of acid will soon destroy an ordinary pair of shoes. Specialized laboratory footwear is designed for specific applications and settings. ",safety
529,3. Protective Clothing ,safety
530,"The protective clothing safety symbol indicates that a lab coat or other protective clothing needs to be worn. There are several types of lab coats for different types of protection. Cotton protects against flying objects, sharp or rough edges, and is usually treated with a fire retardant. Since many synthetic fabrics can adhere to skin when burning, cotton is the most preferred laboratory clothing fabric. Wool protects against splashes of molten materials, small quantities of acid, and small flames. Synthetic fibers protect against sparks and infrared or ultraviolet radiation. Aluminized and reflective clothing protect against radiant heat. ",safety
531,4. Safety Glasses ,safety
532,"The eye protection safety sign indicates there is the possibility of chemical, environmental, radiological, or mechanical irritants and hazards in the laboratory. Eyeshields, also called safety glasses, goggles, or spectacles, not only provide protection against flying debris and chemical splashes in the lab, but may also protect against visible and near visible light or radiation from UV rays, depending on the lens material. The most popular lens material for lab safety eyewear is polycarbonate. This material has less than half the weight of glass, making the eyewear more comfortable to wear. Modern eyeshield designs offer anti-slip nose bridges, anti-fog lenses, and coatings, which make them resistant to acids, caustics, and hydrocarbons. ",safety
533,5. Breathing Masks ,safety
534,"Respirators are designed to prevent contaminated air from entering the body. “Half mask” respirators cover just the nose and mouth; “full face” respirators cover the entire face; and “hood” or “helmet” style respirators cover the entire head. Respirators can protect the user in two ways: By cleaning the “dirty” outside air that passes through a filter or adsorption bed or both when one inhales; or by supplying clean breathing air from a remote source. The clean air can either be delivered via a supply line, or the clean air is packaged and carried with you in a tank. The breathing mask safety sign lets you know that you’re working in an area with potentially contaminated air. ",safety
535,6. Face Shields ,safety
536,"The face protection safety symbol lets lab personnel know that a large face shield, similar to the glass shield on a motorcycle helmet, must be worn when executing experiments that carry the potential of causing an explosion inside of the hood. Full face (and possibly throat) protection from splash and/or impact is commonly required for work on or in the presence of human pathogens, some laboratory chemicals, explosion hazards, heavy grinding and heavy spraying or splashing, and with large (2 L and larger) quantities of dangerous liquids such as acids, bases, and many organic liquids. A face shield can also afford extra protection against extreme temperatures. ",safety
537,7. Hearing Protection ,safety
538,"Noise in laboratories has become a growing concern. While the noise levels in most laboratories are below the threshold level that damages hearing, laboratory noise can be fairly loud. The operation of large analyzers (e.g., chemistry analyzer), fume hoods, biosafety cabinets, incubators, cell washers, tissue homogenizers, and stirrer motors, all contribute to the noise level. There is a wide variety of hearing protection devices available. Different devices are designed to protect against different severities of noise. The ear protection safety symbol indicates that lab workers are in a dangerously high decibel noise range. ",safety
539,8. Eye Wash Station ,safety
540,"The eye wash safety sign indicates the location of an eyewash station. Eye wash stations provide a continuous, low-pressure stream of aerated water in laboratories in which chemical or biological agents are used or stored and in facilities where nonhuman primates are handled. The eyewash station should be easily accessible from any part of the laboratory and, if possible, located near the safety shower so that, if necessary, the eyes can be washed while the body is showered. ",safety
541,9. Safety Shower ,safety
542,"Safety showers need to be installed in all areas where laboratory employees may be exposed to splashes or spills of materials that may be injurious to the eyes and body. As a general rule, new shower installations should adhere to the recommendations for shower location and minimum performance requirements established in American National Standard Z-358.1 (1998). Showers should be placed as close to the hazard as possible, but in no case more than 10 seconds' travel time from the hazard. Safety shower signage should be prominently displayed close to the shower. ",safety
543,10. Wash Hands ,safety
544,"Hand washing is a primary safeguard against inadvertent exposure to toxic chemicals or biological agents. The wash hands safety sign lets lab personnel know to wash their hands after removing soiled protective clothing, before leaving the laboratory, and before eating, drinking, smoking, or using a rest room. Workers should also wash their hands periodically during the day at intervals dictated by the nature of their work. Wash with soap and running water, with hands held downward to flush the contamination off the hands. Turn the tap off with a clean paper towel to prevent recontamination, and dry hands with clean towels. ",safety
545,11. Food & Drink Prohibited ,safety

107,Group of interacting living organisms sharing a populated environment; a social unit of human organisms who share common values ,community
108,"A community is a small or large social unit (a group of living things) that has something in common, such as norms, religion, values, customs, or identity. Communities often share a sense of place that is situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighbourhood) or in virtual space through communication platforms. Durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community. People tend to define those social ties as important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions (such as family, home, work, government, society, or humanity at-large).[1][need quotation to verify][2] Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties (micro-level), ""community"" may also refer to large group affiliations (or macro-level), such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities.[3] ",community
109,"The English-language word ""community"" derives from the Old French comuneté, which comes from the Latin communitas ""community"", ""public spirit"" (from Latin communis, ""shared in common"").[4] ",community
110,"Archaeological studies of social communities use the term ""community"" in two ways, paralleling usage in other areas. The first is an informal definition of community as a place where people used to live. In this sense it is synonymous with the concept of an ancient settlement - whether a hamlet, village, town, or city. The second meaning resembles the usage of the term in other social sciences: a community is a group of people living near one another who interact socially. Social interaction on a small scale can be difficult to identify with archaeological data. Most reconstructions of social communities by archaeologists rely on the principle that social interaction in the past was conditioned by physical distance. Therefore, a small village settlement likely constituted a social community, and spatial subdivisions of cities and other large settlements may have formed communities. Archaeologists typically use similarities in material culture—from house types to styles of pottery—to reconstruct communities in the past. This classification method relies on the assumption that people or households will share more similarities in the types and styles of their material goods with other members of a social community than they will with outsiders.[5] ",community
111,"In ecology, a community is an assemblage of populations of different species, interacting with one another. Community ecology is the branch of ecology that studies interactions between and among species. It considers how such interactions, along with interactions between species and the abiotic environment, affect community structure and species richness, diversity and patterns of abundance. Species interact in three ways: competition, predation and mutualism. Competition typically results in a double negative—that is both species lose in the interaction. Predation is a win/lose situation with one species winning. Mutualism, on the other hand, involves both species cooperating in some way, with both winning. The two main types of communities are major which are self-sustaining and self-regulating (such as a forest or a lake) and minor communities which rely on other communities (like fungi decomposing a log) and are the building blocks of major communities. ",community
112,"This is a simplified example of a community. A community includes many populations and how they interact with each other. In this example there's an interaction between the zebra and the bush, and the lion and the zebra, as well as the bird and the organisms by the water, like the worms. ",community
113,"In Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft (1887), German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies described two types of human association: Gemeinschaft (usually translated as ""community"") and Gesellschaft (""society"" or ""association""). Tönnies proposed the Gemeinschaft–Gesellschaft dichotomy as a way to think about social ties. No group is exclusively one or the other. Gemeinschaft stress personal social interactions, and the roles, values, and beliefs based on such interactions. Gesellschaft stress indirect interactions, impersonal roles, formal values, and beliefs based on such interactions.[6] ",community
114,"In a seminal 1986 study, McMillan and Chavis[7] identify four elements of ""sense of community"": ",community
115,"membership: feeling of belonging or of sharing a sense of personal relatedness, ",community
116,"influence: mattering, making a difference to a group and of the group mattering to its members ",community
117,"reinforcement: integration and fulfillment of needs, ",community
118,shared emotional connection. ,community
119,To what extent do participants in joint activities experience a sense of community? ,community
120,"A ""sense of community index (SCI) was developed by Chavis and colleagues, and revised and adapted by others. Although originally designed to assess sense of community in neighborhoods, the index has been adapted for use in schools, the workplace, and a variety of types of communities.[8] ",community
121,"Studies conducted by the APPA[who?] indicate that young adults who feel a sense of belonging in a community, particularly small communities, develop fewer psychiatric and depressive disorders than those who do not have the feeling of love and belonging.[citation needed] ",community
122,Lewes Bonfire Night procession commemorating 17 Protestant martyrs burnt at the stake from 1555 to 1557 ,community
123,"The process of learning to adopt the behavior patterns of the community is called socialization. The most fertile time of socialization is usually the early stages of life, during which individuals develop the skills and knowledge and learn the roles necessary to function within their culture and social environment.[9] For some psychologists, especially those in the psychodynamic tradition, the most important period of socialization is between the ages of one and ten. But socialization also includes adults moving into a significantly different environment, where they must learn a new set of behaviors.[10] ",community
124,"Socialization is influenced primarily by the family, through which children first learn community norms. Other important influences include schools, peer groups, people, mass media, the workplace, and government. The degree to which the norms of a particular society or community are adopted determines one's willingness to engage with others. The norms of tolerance, reciprocity, and trust are important ""habits of the heart,"" as de Tocqueville put it, in an individual's involvement in community.[11] ",community
125,"Community development is often linked with community work or community planning, and may involve stakeholders, foundations, governments, or contracted entities including non-government organisations (NGOs), universities or government agencies to progress the social well-being of local, regional and, sometimes, national communities. More grassroots efforts, called community building or community organizing, seek to empower individuals and groups of people by providing them with the skills they need to effect change in their own communities.[12] These skills often assist in building political power through the formation of large social groups working for a common agenda. Community development practitioners must understand both how to work with individuals and how to affect communities' positions within the context of larger social institutions. Public administrators, in contrast, need to understand community development in the context of rural and urban development, housing and economic development, and community, organizational and business development. ",community
126,"At the intersection between community development and community building are a number of programs and organizations with community development tools. One example of this is the program of the Asset Based Community Development Institute of Northwestern University. The institute makes available downloadable tools[14] to assess community assets and make connections between non-profit groups and other organizations that can help in community building. The Institute focuses on helping communities develop by ""mobilizing neighborhood assets"" – building from the inside out rather than the outside in.[15] In the disability field, community building was prevalent in the 1980s and 1990s with roots in John McKnight's approaches.[16][17] ",community
127,In The Different Drum: Community-Making and Peace (1987) Scott Peck argues that the almost accidental sense of community that exists at times of crisis can be consciously built. Peck believes that conscious community building is a process of deliberate design based on the knowledge and application of certain rules.[18] He states that this process goes through four stages:[19] ,community
128,"Pseudocommunity: When people first come together, they try to be ""nice"" and present what they feel are their most personable and friendly characteristics. ",community
129,"Chaos: People move beyond the inauthenticity of pseudo-community and feel safe enough to present their ""shadow"" selves. ",community
130,"Emptiness: Moves beyond the attempts to fix, heal and convert of the chaos stage, when all people become capable of acknowledging their own woundedness and brokenness, common to human beings. ",community
131,True community: Deep respect and true listening for the needs of the other people in this community. ,community
132,"In 1991, Peck remarked that building a sense of community is easy but maintaining this sense of community is difficult in the modern world.[20][further explanation needed] ",community
133,"Community building can use a wide variety of practices, ranging from simple events (e.g., potlucks, small book clubs) to larger-scale efforts (e.g., mass festivals, construction projects that involve local participants rather than outside contractors). ",community
134,"Community building that is geared toward citizen action is usually termed ""community organizing.""[22] In these cases, organized community groups seek accountability from elected officials and increased direct representation within decision-making bodies. Where good-faith negotiations fail, these constituency-led organizations seek to pressure the decision-makers through a variety of means, including picketing, boycotting, sit-ins, petitioning, and electoral politics. ",community
135,"Community organizing can focus on more than just resolving specific issues. Organizing often means building a widely accessible power structure, often with the end goal of distributing power equally throughout the community. Community organizers generally seek to build groups that are open and democratic in governance. Such groups facilitate and encourage consensus decision-making with a focus on the general health of the community rather than a specific interest group. ",community
136,"If communities are developed based on something they share in common, whether location or values, then one challenge for developing communities is how to incorporate individuality and differences. Rebekah Nathan suggests[according to whom?] in her book, My Freshman Year, we are drawn to developing communities totally based on sameness, despite stated commitments to diversity, such as those found on university websites. ",community
137,"Some communities have developed their own local exchange trading systems (LETS)[23] and local currencies, such as the Ithaca Hours system,[24] to encourage economic growth and an enhanced sense of community. Community currencies have recently proven valuable in meeting the needs of people living in various South American nations, particularly Argentina, that recently suffered as a result of the collapse of the Argentinian national currency.[25] ",community
138,"Participants in Diana Leafe Christian's ""Heart of a Healthy Community"" seminar circle during an afternoon session at O.U.R. Ecovillage ",community
139,A number of ways to categorize types of community have been proposed. One such breakdown is as follows: ,community
140,"Location-based Communities: range from the local neighbourhood, suburb, village, town or city, region, nation or even the planet as a whole. These are also called communities of place. ",community
141,"Organizationally based Communities: range from communities organized informally around family or network-based guilds and associations to more formal incorporated associations, political decision making structures, economic enterprises, or professional associations at a small, national or international scale. ",community
142,"The usual categorizations of community relations have a number of problems:[26] (1) they tend to give the impression that a particular community can be defined as just this kind or another; (2) they tend to conflate modern and customary community relations; (3) they tend to take sociological categories such as ethnicity or race as given, forgetting that different ethnically defined persons live in different kinds of communities —grounded, interest-based, diasporic, etc.[27] ",community
143,"In response to these problems, Paul James and his colleagues have developed a taxonomy that maps community relations, and recognizes that actual communities can be characterized by different kinds of relations at the same time:[28] ",community
144,"Grounded community relations. This involves enduring attachment to particular places and particular people. It is the dominant form taken by customary and tribal communities. In these kinds of communities, the land is fundamental to identity. ",community
145,"Life-style community relations. This involves giving primacy to communities coming together around particular chosen ways of life, such as morally charged or interest-based relations or just living or working in the same location. Hence the following sub-forms: ",community
146,"community-life as morally bounded, a form taken by many traditional faith-based communities. ",community
147,"community-life as interest-based, including sporting, leisure-based and business communities which come together for regular moments of engagement. ",community
148,"community-life as proximately-related, where neighbourhood or commonality of association forms a community of convenience, or a community of place (see below). ",community
149,"Projected community relations. This is where a community is self-consciously treated as an entity to be projected and re-created. It can be projected as through thin advertising slogan, for example gated community, or can take the form of ongoing associations of people who seek political integration, communities of practice[29] based on professional projects, associative communities which seek to enhance and support individual creativity, autonomy and mutuality. A nation is one of the largest forms of projected or imagined community. ",community
150,"In these terms, communities can be nested and/or intersecting; one community can contain another—for example a location-based community may contain a number of ethnic communities.[30] Both lists above can used in a cross-cutting matrix in relation to each other. ",community
151,"An online ""community"" that allows user anonymity builds weaker bonds than an actual community[citation needed]. Sites that offer online interaction between individuals, like Myspace, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, Pinterest and Discord. allow (even tacitly encourage) users to stalk and bully others in their community[citation needed], protected by anonymity, because confrontation drives interaction, and thus revenue[citation needed]. ""An audience isn’t just a big community; it can be more anonymous, with many fewer ties among users. A community isn’t just a small audience either; it has a social density that audiences lack.""

181,10 Community Event Ideas To Bring Everyone Together ,community
182,"Local events are a great way to bring communities closer together. Whether you want to raise funds for a worthy cause, bring about positive change in your area, celebrate something special or simply get to know your neighbours, a community event will help rally the masses. ",community
183,"Deciding what type of event you should hold will depend on your goals, as well as the size and demographic of your target audience. However, here are 10 tried and trusted ideas for community events that should help get everyone together. For further ideas, tips and tricks for community events, join the discussion over industry forum EventTribe. ",community
184,1. Host a street party ,community
185,"Street parties or ‘block parties’ are said to have originated in New York at the start of World War 1. Entire blocks were roped off so a parade and patriotic singing could be held to honour the members of that block who had gone off to war. In the UK, street parties started in 1919 as ‘Peace Teas’ after the war as a treat for children in those times of hardship, and were formal sit down affairs. ",community
186,"From then onwards, street parties were commonly held in England and Wales on all major national days of celebration, such as the coronation of Queen Elizabeth in 1953 and the wedding of Charles and Diana in 1981. ",community
187,"Street parties are now being held at any time, for all ages, to build community spirit at the street level. They are a more relaxed affair with attendees asked to bring a dish to share or with a barbecue arranged. According to Streets Alive, a resource for street party planning, Bristol is the UK’s street party capital with around 150 held each year. ",community
188,"The government has produced a step-by-step guide for anyone looking to hold a street party, which can be downloaded here. ",community
189,2. Put on a film screening ,community
190,"Who doesn’t enjoy watching a great movie on a big screen with a tub of tasty popcorn? You can organise a film screening at a local school, church, community centre or even outside, under the stars. Choose to screen a recent blockbuster or go for an old classic and embrace a theme, like ‘The Rocky Horror Show’ with guests encouraged to come in fancy dress. ",community
191,"On the other hand, if you have a message to get across or are marking a particular occasion you can choose a relevant movie i.e. ‘The Dam Busters’ to commemorate Remembrance Day or ‘The Fault in Our Stars’ to raise awareness about living with cancer. ",community
192,"But don’t forget, under UK copyright law, if you are playing films outside your domestic or home circle, you will need to obtain a licence to do so (even for free of charge events and fundraisers). ",community
193,You can apply online for a Single Title Screening Licence (STSL) – prices start at £83 (plus £150 refundable deposit). For a full price list click here. ,community
194,3. Organise a pub quiz ,community
195,"A quiz night with general knowledge questions can appeal to a broad audience, or you can target particular groups by focusing on specialist subjects, such as football or music. Theming your quiz can also give it an extra edge; for example, how about holding one on Halloween with questions about horror films, along with spooky decorations to get everyone in the spirit! ",community
196,"The hardest part of holding a quiz night is inevitably writing the questions. If you research your own trivia on the internet, then be careful how you select the sites you choose to get the questions from. Do not just crib from the first list of horror movie facts you come across – your participants may well have been on the same website! ",community
197,"Alternatively, you can buy a pre-made quiz pack. Quizpacks.co.uk offers a ‘Quiz of the Month’ with a mix of general knowledge questions or a ‘Bespoke Quizpack’ where you can choose from a range of different topics for each round category. ",community
198,4. Gather a gardening gang ,community
199,"If there’s a green space in your community that has seen better days, why not organise a group of volunteers to restore it to its former glory? Digging out weeds, picking litter and planting flowers will transform it into something for all to enjoy and encourage people to take an active part in caring for their local area. ",community
200,"Or perhaps your child’s school has an unused area of playing field that could be put to better use? Approach the PTA about turning it into a vegetable patch with the help of parents and pupils, growing produce for school dinners while teaching the children about where food comes from. ",community
201,"Alternatively, bring everybody together to brighten up your street by holding a ‘make a hanging basket’ event. Challenge all your neighbours to get involved and award a prize for the best blooms. ",community
202,5. Hold a swap shop ,community
203,"Holding a swapping event can have both social and environmental benefits for your community. Not only does it minimise the number of unwanted items going to landfill, but it also helps those in need – according to official statistics, there are 4 million children in the UK living in households that cannot afford to replace worn out or broken furniture and electrical items. ",community
204,A swap shop is a cashless local event where people exchange unwanted items for something they do want. Not everyone needs to bring something – the more takers the better it will mean you will have very little left over at the end. ,community
205,You may choose to have an event at a specific venue or simply a day when everyone puts their unwanted items out on the street and anyone can take what they want. ,community
206,Just remember to notify the local council first and arrange for the anything not claimed to be taken to a local charity shop or furniture reuse organisation afterwards. ,community
207,6. Organise an arts & crafts festival ,community
208,"In every community, there are budding artists and craft enthusiasts that you could bring together by creating your own arts & crafts festival. ",community
209,"The term arts & crafts covers such a magnitude of different disciplines, that there really isn’t anything stopping you setting up stalls selling anything you want; from pottery to watercolours, knitted wear to jewellery, there’ll be something for everyone to buy. ",community
210,"A community in Highams Park created a community arts festival and managed to get a local street artist hub to come down and create some live art. If you’re trying to reach younger members of the community, live street art is a great way to get them to your festival. ",community
211,"Many street artist newcomers may work for free in order to build some publicity, if you will be adding a charitable element to the festival, the artist may even let you auction or raffle off their artwork. ",community
212,"The Highams Park Arts Festival also included installations throughout the town, most of which were interactive requiring the community to get crafty themselves and add to the pieces. This is a great way to get people to walk around different parts of town, as well as making them part of the festival itself. ",community
213,7. Use a themed day ,community
214,"There are a multitude of different themed days you could utilise, you only need to check out the website ‘Days of the Year‘ to see how many different “National’ days are out there. ",community
215,"A firm favourite, which will also help your local library, is World Book Day. The best way to get the community involved is by getting everyone to dress as their favourite character from any book they choose. This could mean dressing as Where’s Wally, The Cat in the Hat, Mr Darcy even! The possibilities are endless! ",community
216,"Invite local authors, or even famous authors who have ties to your community. You can organise a selection of readings with an open-mic night, and why not organise a poetry competition and get a local bookshop to donate prizes? ",community
217,8. Organise a performance ,community
218,"Amateur dramatics has been a long standing part of the community, so why not gather some aspiring thespians together and organise a show? ",community
219,"This doesn’t have to be on a stage in the community hall, why not change things up and create a walking performance? Get the audience to follow a set course around town, where they can watch parts of the play in certain areas. Have your actors do scenes or interact with the audience in-between stops, making them part of the performance. ",community
220,"Use the seasons to your advantage to entice people to see your performance. Everyone loves getting into the Christmas Spirit around December, so why not perform ‘A Christmas Carol’? Or you could make use of a nearby forest or gardens to perform ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ when the summer months are here. ",community
221,9. Food Festival/Farmer’s Market ,community
222,Who can say no to delicious food? Especially when the town is filled with the most amazing smells! ,community
223,"Whether you get some local farmers, caterers or local food shops together, this is a great way to highlight the local produce and local sellers in the area. As well as getting to eat all the delicious food at the event, people will know they will be able to buy this produce locally on any other given day. ",community
224,"Why not think Great British Bake Off and ask the community to create their own showstopper cakes and raffle them off. No one can turn down cake, especially if you have a tea stand nearby! ",community
225,10. Fireworks / Bonfire Night ,community
226,"Fireworks always bring in the crowds. There is something about lighting up the sky that just amazes people. Add a bonfire to the equation and you have a perfect winter event. Serve hearty food like jacket potatoes, with a hot chocolate (maybe a Baileys hot chocolate for the adults) and you’ll keep the crown fed, watered, and more importantly, warm! ",community
227,"You may be limited to using fireworks to certain nights of the year like Guy Fawkes Night and New Year’s Eve, but there isn’t anything stopping you having your own bonfire night with all the added activities to go with it, like lighting sparklers and toasted marshmallows. ",community
228,Conclusion ,community
229,"Holding a community event is well worth the effort. Whether you’re organising it on behalf of your organisation, club, church or just for your neighbourhood, bringing people together in this way helps create a more caring and inclusive community. Ultimately, it can make your local area a nicer place to live. ",community

231,"That feeling of ‘seen it, done it’ it’s always lingering around. ",community

233,"Our boss demands them, our attendees want them, our sponsors crave them. ",community
234,"So how do you impress attendees, regardless of the type of events you plan? ",community

237,20 Fundraising Event Ideas That Make a Difference ,community
238,"Fundraising events must be among the most difficult types of events out there. You are inviting people in a room to ask for their money. For a good cause, of course, but still you are asking for their money. ",community
239,Coming up with cool fundraising ideas that make an impact is not always easy. Getting the audience to empathize with your cause can be a challenge. ,community
240,"No worries, we are here to help. ",community
241,"Let’s look first at some strategies to tackle the ever-changing world of fundraising events, then we will share some of the most effective event ideas out there. ",community
242,Utilize Storytelling ,community
243,"Stories can truly connect your audience’s emotions to the cause you are fundraising for. Without a face or story to represent your fundraising need, your donors won’t be able to envision or feel exactly how worthy your cause is. People are inclined to give when they connect on an emotional level with a speaker or a personal journey. By sharing these types of heartfelt stories with your audience at an event, you are much more likely to increase your charitable contributions. ",community
244,Tug the heartstrings: ,community
245,"At the event, set aside a time to educate your audience about your cause and show them the impact they are making. ",community
246,"Use storytelling through things like photographs, videos, quotations, and artwork. ",community
247,"Providing your donors with actual examples of where the money raised is going and the impact it is having, will provide gratification to your donors and encourage them to continue giving during future campaigns. You should always be looking for the chance to show your donors what their gifts are accomplishing. ",community

253,Cater to Your Donor ,community
254,"Everyone loves to feel special at an event, especially a high-level donor or top-tier sponsor. You should try to make each one of your guests feel like the most important person in the room, in order to provide a great customer service experience and make them more inclined to open their pocketbooks for your charity. By making attendees feel special, they will be much more inclined to give to your cause or spend some extra money while attending your event. Everyone enjoys feeling like a VIP, so do your best to show all of the guests attending your event that their dollar truly matters. ",community
255,Make them feel special: ,community
256,"Calling your guests by name upon arrival and recognizing them for their generosity at every chance you get, will go a really long way in providing a positive and lasting impression. ",community
257,Place VIP board members’ names on the invitation. When people receive an invitation if they recognize a name they feel more obligated and motivated to attend. ,community
258,"Place VIPs on your event board. People who give buy-in and advice on something feel an added incentive to see how it turns out, which means they’ll also attend. This also helps you build a closer relationship with them. ",community
259,Stay Connected ,community
260,Being connected to your donors and supporters during the event is easier than ever with social media and digital devices. Being tapped into the vibe of your outing will give you a good perspective on the impact your event has had and perhaps the likelihood of your fundraising success. ,community
261,Are people sharing information about your cause or event with their network? Fundraising is a very social project in this digitally connected world. Almost every day we see someone online who is raising money or awareness for a cause they care about. By making your events more socially connected you will increase your visibility and build upon your potential fundraising income. ,community
262,Boost engagement: ,community
263,You can follow along with your group through event hashtags and apps during the event ,community
264,Don’t be afraid to ask attendees how they are doing with pre-and post-event surveys! ,community
265,Connect the digital and physical attendees with a live social wall during your event and flood with messages of donations and support for the cause. ,community
266,Here are 20 event ideas to bolster fundraising revenue at your next event. ,community
267,Silent Auction ,community
268,"Whether it is experiences or donated products and items, silent auctions can be an interesting way to raise funds during the event without the hassle of organizing a real auction. Bidders simply fill out a form with their information and the highest amount they would pay for each item. Highest bid wins. Make it interesting by adding valuable items or experiences such as coaching or speaker sessions for the corporate crowd. ",community
269,Donation Matching ,community
270,"Find a sponsor or company to match the donation amount that you raise so that you can immediately double it. This incentivizes guests to donate more as they know it will be worth twice as much as they give. If you can’t find someone to do this for your event as a whole you could ask individual sponsors to double their bid if you reach a certain criterion, e.g. finish a sporting challenge or reach a milestone amount. ",community
271,Digital Donations ,community
272,"Don’t forget about your digital attendees who may want to help raise funds but are unable to attend. Making digital donations available by sharing links to a secure funding page on your event social media can help expand reach and makes fundraising more accessible. It also works well during a live stream or social media wall and makes fundraising accessible before, during and after your event. ",community
273,Subscribe today and get 12 Free books + 61 templates ,community
274,"The traditional donation box is getting a revamp with kiosks that take contactless or card payments, no more having to cash checks for your fundraiser. ",community
275,Benefitted Keynote ,community
276,"Invite guests who are affected by the cause you are trying to raise to speak at the keynote on behalf of others. Motivational or inspiring stories, as well as seeing the affected can hit home for many and encourage more donations. ",community
277,Raffles ,community
278,"Highly popular, particularly with low budgets because you can have prizes donated and it’s simply the cost of the tickets that you have to pay for. Incentivize this further by introducing a 50:50 split where the tickets are placed into a bowl and the prize is half of the amount raised by the ticket sales. The other half goes to the designated charity. ",community
279,Bring to Buy ,community
280,"From cakes and food to clothing or nearly new items, bring to buy are highly popular for fundraisers. It prompts others to have a declutter or get creative while working towards a good cause at the same time. ",community
281,Sponsored Bar ,community
282,"Rather than a free bar, the sponsor agrees to match whatever was made in drinks and donate to a charity. This is perfect, particularly if they are marketing with a custom cocktail so it is a win-win and also encourages drinking for a good cause! ",community
283,Pay Per Themes ,community
284,"If you have a crowd that love to dress up, create a theme that they have to pay to enter. For example, pay $5 to come to the event in an ugly jumper, fancy dress or themed costume. These are particularly fun for corporate events where attendees end up wearing the costumes around the office first. You could turn this around by paying to see someone else dress up rather than yourself, the one with the most pledges wins (or loses depending on your perception) but the amount raised is donated in their name. ",community
285,Gamification ,community
286,Attendees are more likely to pay to play games or activities they are participating in which makes sports and gamification popular for fundraising. Organize a simple pay to play mini-game such as guess the sweets in the jar or go big and organize an entire sports tournament as part of your event. The winners can receive a product or service from sponsors and the money goes to the charity. ,community
287,The “Donate” Button ,community
288,This is a simple button that attendees can click on your website and social media for quick and easy donations. You could also recreate it with a donation box of the same shape! Bringing a quirky twist to the traditional and ensuring it stands out. ,community
289,Full Valet Service ,community
290,"An excellent corporate fundraising idea is to have a valet and car wash available for attendees while they are in the event. The proceeds go to the designated charity, guests are more likely to pay a bit extra for the cause and they have the car cleaned while having fun! ",community
291,Purchase Tables ,community
292,"A traditional fundraising option is to have tables available to purchase at the event. This adds a sense of exclusivity and ensures that overheads are met and exceeded at large, seated fundraising events. ",community
293,Homemade Carnival ,community
294,"If the budget allows carnival rides like the one below, excellent but if it doesn’t there are still plenty of fundraising opportunities for your event within the carnival theme. You could opt for smaller, homemade stalls such as the coconut shy, plate smash, raffles and tombola stalls or alternatively for corporate carnivals you could play dunk the boss! ",community
295,"Get an influencer or celebrity guest involved in your fundraising for causes that they are passionate about. Even if you can’t get them to attend the event themselves they could still publicly donate to your cause, prompting others to do the same. Plus, it’s an excellent way to spread awareness. ",community
296,Animal Guests ,community
297,"For animal fundraising, work with local shelters or sanctuaries to bring animal guests to your event to pose for photos or be part of the keynote. Animals strike a chord with people and chances are you’ll have attendees with pets so they will be more likely to donate seeing the animals themselves. Everyone loves an underdog (or cat) story. ",community
298,Capitalize on the selfie and photo booth popularity at your event by turning them into fundraising machines. You could have them branded with the charity or cause information to boost awareness or offer pay per print with the proceeds going to charity. ,community
299,Fundraising Exhibition ,community
300,"Ask attendees to take photographs and submit them before the event, have the best ones blown up onto canvas and create a “crowdsourced” art exhibition. Charge for tickets and auction the photos at the end (or have a silent auction!) ",community
301,Host a Slumber Party ,community
302,"Have pyjamas as the fancy dress idea and play an old movie, cinema style. Charge for movie tickets at your event as well as for popcorn and drinks. Offer other areas, for example a pamper zone or lounge, custom cocktails and pillow fight entertainment as part of the party to raise funds. ",community
303,Fashion Show ,community
304,"Have local talent, boutiques or even attendees submit their fashion designs and charge for entry to the fashion show. You could offer this as part of the entertainment at your event or go all out and make it a feature itself. ",community
305,20 Creative Corporate Event Ideas to Use Today ,community
306,"Making a corporate environment fun and engaging can be difficult when you also have to consider keeping a professional image at all times. The pressure is on to raise intrigue among attendees, whilst staying totally on brand. ",community
307,"In the meantime, if you’re looking for ideas and inspiration, we’re here to help with some of the most effective corporate event ideas we’ve seen to date. You never know, one of these ideas might just be the one that turns your corporate event into the event of the year! ",community
308,Here are 20 corporate event ideas for you to steal. ,community
309,360 Videography/Photos ,community
310,Capture the ambiance and atmosphere of the event using the increasingly popular 360 video and photography which can be used during a live stream to make virtual attendees wish they were there and feel like they are! Integrating 360 video seamlessly can be difficult but also paves the way for augmented reality at your event too. ,community
311,Roaming Competitions ,community
312,A funky guerrilla marketing tactic for corporate events is to create pop-up ideas that spark intrigue and excitement. Build on this by making them roam and moveable. You could do this across the country or even in the office with different elements popping up in different departments each day. They create surprise and buzz about where it could be found next and helps with immediate brand recognition. ,community
313,Une publication partagée par Plano Event Center (@planoeventcenter) le 7 Nov. 2017 à 7 :26 PST ,community
314,"Staff are just as important to the aesthetic so ensuring they are incorporated into themes and color schemes is important. Mix it up by having intricate uniforms, such as these pajamas at the annual meta mixer in line with their sweet dreams theme. ",community
315,"Credit: Destinations by Design, Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas (catering) ",community
316,Bespoke Mini Boards ,community
317,"Create a quirky set menu with this lavish presentation so guests have their own boards. These include ham hock terrine, beetroot crisps and pickles in a beautiful display served with silverware. ",community
318,"Corporate events need excellent styling and while this theme is a Gatsby one, it remains classy and sophisticated. Drawing on the black and cold, a trailing balloon ceiling that spread outwards added a level of intimacy to the event. Balloons are an important décor trend for 2018 and are multi-functional too, so don’t count them out. ",community
319,Dessert Signage ,community
320,"A classic, but still incredibly effective, particularly if you get the right food choice and make it shine! These are the perfect example of dessert branding done right with these sophisticatedly stylish treats. The more appetizing, the more they will be photographed and shared, improving the sponsor’s reach. ",community
321,"Digital mapping at this gala showcases different images and projects them, which creates an interactive and engaging way to bring to attendees. The images themselves can be automated and moving and in some cases, integrated with the ability to interact with attendees when they are near for some thrilling fun and wow factor. ",community
322,Canape Spoons ,community
323,"Buffets and canapes tend to remove some catering options because, logistically, you can’t serve difficult foods or those needing utensils without plates. Canape spoons are the latest things to make this possible and open up a realm of possibilities for your menu. ",community
324,Branded Balloons ,community
325,"Balloons are often a go-to décor piece for corporate events and can be very effective as they are usually used for centerpieces, welcome décor or standing décor attached to weights. Helium balloons are the favorite for standalone décor and pack more of a punch than traditional balloons. ",community
326,Big Scalextric ,community
327,"Be big kids at the event with Scalextric races and gamification. You could create an incentivized leaderboard or tournament lasting throughout the event with prizes for the winners. Even without the incentives, you’ll find it is quite popular and unique. ",community
328,Corporate Penthouse ,community
329,"Converting corporate spaces can be difficult but this penthouse creation is stunning. With a marble bar and lounge area for networking and comfort, as well as seated dinner and candle-lit walkways it’s definitely transformative. ",community
330,"You can offer branded swag before the event, as an early bird incentive, giveaway or to bring to the event. This gives attendees the opportunity to show it off and encourage others to look into registering or signing up before the event. Alternatively, give swag at the registration desk and entrance or in goody bags on the way out. ",community
331,Branded Segways ,community
332,"Plenty of branding opportunities and perfect for large event transportation or pre-event build-up. Segways are still interesting and a novelty for many, even though they were released years ago. You could make them available to rent from your booth at trade shows, giving you excellent reach as they make an impact, or ride them in public to market your event. ",community
333,Dinner Boxes ,community
334,"Food is normally the next point of call after a long or out of hours meeting, so take away the worry and send them home with dinner and dessert. These combination boxes have a variety of amazing food and can be adapted to suit your attendee preferences. ",community
335,Branded Furniture ,community
336,"From tables, chairs and food stations to cushions, marques and shelving, branding can be used on a variety of furniture surfaces which is why lounges are such a good idea. ",community
337,Gesture Control Presentations ,community
338,Increasing technology now means we can avoid the awkward clickers and weird pointing to the presentation control for a seamless speech or presentation. These gesture control armbands allow those on stage to motion when it is time to move on which can be integrated into the presentation for better delivery. ,community
339,Private Chef ,community

342,An excellent way to make a larger venue feel more intimate is with lighting or similar effects and these simple but effective GOBO’s create a speckled effect that enhances the natural features of this venue. ,community
343,"For retreats, workshops or events that last several days, you could offer free accommodation as part of a giveaway package before or during the event. Before the event would offer more flexibility and allow you better rates to negotiate a hotel package beforehand but even during the event you could offer to cover accommodation costs for the event. Alternatively, you could simply offer an unrelated overnight stay in a luxury hotel that has other amenities such as a spa or fitness center as a mini-break. ",community
344,Segmented Escape Rooms ,community
345,"Escape rooms are growing in popularity as a team building exercise but you can now create your own so attendees don’t have to travel.

349,3 Tips For Event Entertainment ,community
350,Multi-Level ,community
351,"You want to entertain on various levels, big and small. Of course, a big entertainment act is a great event idea but what will attendees do while they wait? Consider different tiers of entertainment for continued amusement that hits the right note. ",community
352,Different tier mentality: ,community
353,"Consider queuing. If you have elements of your event that may turn into queues and these are unavoidable, entertain them! Having walking entertainers to interact or big screens near the waiting area will make time fly by for guests. ",community
354,Amuse crowds. Just because you have minimal space to maneuver everyone doesn’t mean you are limited to stage entertainment. Simply adding props or interactive crowd games can make it more enjoyable and engaging. ,community
355,"Think small. Don’t forget to think small and consider the personal touches that make entertainment memorable. This could be something as simple as ensuring there is table trivia at a corporate gala for networking, to interactive speakers or roaming entertainment. ",community
356,Make It Social ,community
357,"Don’t just entertain your attendees, entertain your audience by making it go viral! This improves brand reach by getting your event trending and shared globally. ",community
358,Time to connect ,community
359,"Get emotive. People will want to post and share your event if it evokes strong emotions; be it surprise, excitement, awe or amusement! If you use an act, a show or a performer that is so unique (and can also incorporate the brand!) that people are stirred to feeling amazed or surprised, then they are going to want to share their experience with others. ",community
360,"Record it. Don’t rely on attendees to capture the entertainment (particularly if it is a surprise) so ensure you have someone recording it, you never know when the footage may come in handy for full previews or exclusives. ",community
361,"Plan ahead. Don’t be afraid to put some thought into how to make the entertainment viral. Do some research on what is popular, create a buzz that includes entertainment teasers on social media and you could even invite press for coverage! ",community
362,Remember Your Audience ,community
363,Your event style and type will largely dictate what is appropriate or not. Corporate event profs will first have to take a few factors into consideration when ensuring that the entertainment ‘fits’ the event: ,community
364,Know who you’re talking to: ,community
365,"Analyse your demographic. Determine age, social background and sex, and choose entertainment accordingly. A tribute to ‘One Direction’ or ‘Justin Bieber’ may be suitable for a corporate family day event, but not for a black-tie gala dinner. ",community
366,"Consider venue space. Venue size and location is a factor that many event planners and organizers forget (or remember at the last minute!). This is important, as it will play a part in deciding whether or not you can have that aerial team you want or full-scale swing band! ",community
367,"Budget. Do you have a strict budget that you have to work within, or is money not a problem? The amount of money a company is prepared to spend on entertainment will affect the options available. ",community
368,Hungry for entertainment e event ideas? Here are 20 things to inspire your next event. ,community
369,Crowd Props ,community
370,"Everything from beach balls, balloons, giant inflatables or even smaller ideas like bubbles can make the experience more interactive, particularly with huge crowds and audiences that it is difficult to get individual feedback from. These can be a way of tying themes together while making it fun and individual as attendees get involved and play games among themselves which can be a particularly good idea at concerts or festivals. ",community
371,Digital Caricatures ,community
372,"Forget pens and paper, this is caricature art for the New Media Age! Digital caricaturists are one of the most popular options for corporate events that require walkaround entertainment that incorporates technology. Not only will guests want to tweet or post their personal works of art (which can include company logos, branding or products!), but the artist can also email the caricatures to attendees or post them live on to company social media sites! ",community
373,Tarot Reading ,community
374,"For some, adding a mythical or magical booth such as palm, tarot or tea leaf reading can be more fun because of the “supernatural” element and things they can’t explain. In the same way, magicians and card tricksters are popular because people enjoy the things they can’t explain. Remember, the better the reader or performer, the more of an impact they will make. ",community
375,Corporate Percussion ,community
376,"Geared towards corporate clients, artists will perform using products i.e. ladders, machinery, etc. These shows also have added wow factor, as they are a fast paced, high energy performance. ",community

379,Coffee Art ,community
380,"This act gives the term ‘instant art’ a whole new meaning! Your attendees will be bursting to share these little, drinkable, personal works of art via social media. The artist uses a portable coffee machine to capture the likeness of event attendees in their very own cup of delicious coffee. ",community
381,Retro Video Games ,community
382,"Nostalgia can enhance enjoyment at an event, and adding retro video games can bring attendees back to their youth. This awesome idea takes it up a notch by adding a giant element to it and having the traditional Super Mario on a massive controller which can also get others involved playing together! ",community
383,"A post shared by Perfect Parties USA (@perfectpartiesusa) on Mar 27, 2017 at 1:15pm PDT ",community
384,Music is emotive and generally speaks to people so can be an excellent entertainment idea that appeals to many attendees. Make this more interesting by having unique instruments or something different for example dueling pianos on stage. You could also split the crowd into groups and have a musical riff-off against one another or have them complete musical challenges such as singing lines one after the other to create an echo effect. ,community
385,Classy Table Tennis ,community
386,A favorite game with a sophisticated twist! Table tennis is easy to create into mini competitions and you can have up to 4 attendees playing at a time. Create a round robin tournament with teams for a corporate retreat or have “first to five” games to keep it short and sweet! ,community
387,"Whether it’s for a dancefloor, event entrance or the main hall floor, responsive and interactive flooring can be an interesting event idea that is a big hit and makes the venue more engaging without permanent fixtures or adjustments. This can usually be achieved by using projectors and tracking cameras for different effects; some involve moving scenes being displayed with elements interacting with the user as they walk past e.g. a koi pond where the fish swim away when you walk near them. Alternatively, you could have a game where attendees have to run and catch different elements to create a high score, creating an interactive floor game. This could be incorporated on larger floors or upscaled to suit interactions with more guests. ",community
388,iPad Magician ,community
389,"For technology and gadget lovers/events, iPad magicians are the perfect act to amaze and entertain your guests. iPad magicians perform bespoke shows for the digital age, and many high-profile brands and events are eager to experience this unique brand of magical entertainment. ",community
390,Giant Lego ,community
391,"Lego is always hours of fun. Turn kids toys into adult ones by supersizing Lego blocks. You can incorporate this into team building activities at corporate retreats as well as competitions at trade shows by giving attendees 2 minutes to make the best Lego creation, it would be a fun way to drive traffic to your booth. If you don’t have the space for big Lego, why not add miniature Lego packs to table settings for guests to do while they are sitting. ",community
392,"These are proving to be a big hit for corporate events. New technologies have allowed performers to take their dance/visual performances to the next level as humans and computers merge. These acts can incorporate specific music and graphics, as well as logos and corporate messages. ",community
393,Interactive Wait Staff ,community
394,"If you have large crowds but minimal space, particularly for staging, you can get on their level by having interactive wait staff. This could be in the form of singing or dancing staff as well as impersonators, rollerbladers or wearable tables all serving food and drinks while interacting with guests. Ideas like this get people talking and act as conversation starters as well as memorable ideas and experiences. ",community
395,Aerial Performers ,community
396,"A sure-fire way to involve the audience when you have little floor space or room is to have aerial décor, artists and entertainers, performing above their heads. It makes the venue more interactive as a whole while attendees look upwards and can make use of dead space without impacting the floor area if you have a large crowd or audience. Aerial performers also add a thrill element because they are so high up and above the attendees that they feel a part of the act itself. ",community
397,Celebrities/Influencers ,community
398,"Hire celebrities or influencers to attend, speak or interact at your event to generate a buzz. Alternatively, you could have them do a remote Q&A session on your social media channels as part of the entertainment. Don’t have the budget? Try a lookalike to pose with guests on the event floor or entrance, it will definitely get people talking on social media, particularly who is the best one! ",community
399,Street Entertainers ,community

407,20 Promotional Ideas for Events: Start Selling Tickets Now! ,community
408,"Even if you are the best event planner in the world, if people don’t know about your event, they won’t come. ",community
409,"With the ever-competitive event market it is important to stand out and while this may come at a price, it makes the effort worthwhile. ",community
410,"Good promotion can generate more income from sponsors, as well as improve ticket sales, as brands only want to work with events that can improve their reach as well. ",community
411,But how do you stand out with so much noise out there? ,community
412,Event planners say that increased competition is their biggest hurdle in 2018. ,community
413,"So let’s look at some tactics first to approach event promotion, then 20 incredible ideas to sell out! ",community
414,Work With Your Venue ,community
415,"Often, your venue has its own PR team that will be able to lend a helping hand and understands its specifications to promote itself meaning that you can focus on the event at hand. After all, it is in the best interests of the venue that your event is a success. ",community
416,Utilize your assets: ,community
417,"Discuss what you need. Always talk about what your end goal is for promotion. Creating hype, building awareness or driving ticket sales can have slightly different approaches, so make sure you are on the same page. ",community
418,Get your event listed on their event website with a ticket link as early as possible. ,community
419,Do the venue have a newsletter of interested event goers? Can they feature your forthcoming event? ,community
420,Tap into their local knowledge. Do they have contacts and suppliers that may extend reach or have they got inside knowledge into the city you are hosting your event in that might help? ,community
421,Stay Current ,community
422,"People have busy lives, so it is important to keep in the forefront of their minds or they will forget about your event. It’s nothing personal! ",community
423,Get to the forefront: ,community
424,Grow your email list. Do everything you can to grow your email list with those that are truly interested in your event. Having a pop up on your site is a great way to encourage people to receive updates so you can keep in touch if they are not ready to purchase tickets yet. ,community
425,"Newsletter reminders. Use your email list to share tantalising content with newsletter subscribers, but target it towards those that have bought tickets and those still to book. Make the subject line pop so you have better open rates. ",community
426,Social media updates. Engage on social media and ensure that you are around to ask any questions or alleviate issues in the lead up to your event. ,community
427,"Keep it interesting. If you bore them at this stage, chances are they won’t be attending. You could use different mediums or graphics on your channel as well as a temporary change of colors or profile pictures to add that reminder. ",community
428,Content Accessibility ,community
429,Make sure that you are putting your efforts into being accessible when it comes to promoting your event. This could be sharing on different media where your audience are active or simply not confusing your message and diluting interest. ,community
430,Be heard: ,community
431,"Adapt to your audience. If your audience favors Snapchat, start getting up to date on stories and filters you can use. If it’s Instagram, design stunning images that will turn heads! Promotion is all about breaking through the noise and reaching your demographic. ",community
432,Be wherever it matters. Don’t just limit yourself to the normal social networks (although these are useful too.) be where your audience is and this means understanding where is best to reach them. ,community
433,Native checkouts. Allow tickets to be purchased via the different sites and mediums you have promoted on e.g. Facebook. This makes the process efficient meaning you’re more likely to get sales rather than distracted potential guests. ,community
434,Drawing a blank when it comes to promotional ideas? Here are 20 ideas to kick start your promotions right now. ,community
435,Associated Webinar ,community
436,Put together a free two-part webinar that precludes the event and gets attendees excited and educated which could include sneak peeks from speakers as well as industry relevant information. Make part 2 available post-event that includes highlights and key takeaways. ,community
437,Good old billboards ,community
438,"Nobody cares about billboards. Right? Not so fast. If you use them strategically and you target the areas where your attendees tend to come from, you have a fantastic opportunity right there. Search for attendees addresses on your previous year registration. Identify areas with higher concentration of attendees. Whether it is national or local, you can pinpoint specifically those areas sending you more attendees and expose them to a very targeted message. They will feel surprised and intrigued. ",community
439,Strategic Influencer marketing ,community
440,"18% of event planners say that influencer marketing is the most effective tactic to sell tickets. Identify the influencers in your niche that tend to collaborate with events. We are not talking about general influencers popular on a given social networks. We are talking about only those that attend similar events. Invite them to speak, offer VIP treatment, pay for accommodation and expenses. Expect them to blog, tweet, insta and video about your event in return. Remember to get them to disclose your partnership. It’s not just cool, it works! ",community
441,Temporary Website Re-Branding ,community
442,"For a limited time, change the colors of your website to include the theme or vibe of your event. You could add a landing page that takes you straight to the event details with FAQ’s and the information attendees would need. You could also include page pop-ups for commonly used posts or pages to highlight the new event to market and let people know. The important thing to remember is to keep with your brand but make it pop and stand out so that users are aware that it is something new and something to be excited about. ",community
443,Targeted Flyer Dropping ,community
444,"Let’s be honest, flyers are becoming less and less effective and it is no longer good enough to stand in the town center and hand them out because they normally just find their way to the bin. Flyers however don’t have to be wasted and they are still effective if you target them directly to your demographic only and this works better if you choose a niche. ",community
445,"For example, if you are organizing a running event, an effective way of targeted flyer dropping is at other local running or sporting events because your target demographic is all in one place and has their minds on running or fitness. Often, the organizers will allow other brands or organizers to leaflet drop in the goody bags or at the start/finish in exchange for providing a few helpful volunteers for the day (there’s nothing to stop you branding them as well). ",community
446,Car Attachments ,community
447,"Millions of cars drive on the roads every day and other than the radio it can be hard to reach them, spruce your car up with signage and car attachments and drive around or if you prefer, advertise using Taxi’s through big city centers as they are more noticeable and stand out from the crowd. ",community
448,Iams chose to include a wagging cat tail to the back while Snickers renamed a yellow cab as a “Snaxi” during one of their advertising campaigns. ,community
449,What about remarketing? ,community
450,"Event professionals wildly ignore the power of remarketing when it gets to event promotion. It is a great idea to convert more attendees. If someone visits your site, you have two special pixels installed to follow them everywhere on Facebook and Google network. If they abandoned your ticket purchase process, you can incentivize them with a small discount. They are hot leads, you just need to push the decision. ",community
451,Featured Speaker videos ,community
452,Ask your speakers to send short videos shot from their smartphones (in landscape mode) telling your audience why they need to attend their session and what are they going to cover. This is usually a great incentive to make the audience comfortable with the topics that will be discussed and quickly evaluate whether attending your event is worth it. Speakers have an incredible influence on attendees. ,community
453,Get suppliers to promote your event. ,community
454,"While we know how paid speakers and performers can be valuable to help promote an event, especially on social media, we often forget about suppliers that already signed up to attend. As content marketing grows, our suppliers increase their leverage on social networks. Create some collaterals for them to use on social networks, saying that they will attend the event. Also think about banners they can use in their email signatures, customized according to their presence at the show (find us at booth 11000 for an exhibition). ",community
455,Claim support from local authorities ,community
456,"When you run an event somewhere you are bringing an enormous amount of business to local suppliers, communities and cities. What are they giving you in return? Most times a nice logo to use on your website. Get more that that! Ask them to promote the event on their social channels, to use their database if they have one. Reach out to CVBs and DMOs to see if they offer opportunities for free promotion of your event. Asking is more than legitimate. You are bringing business! ",community
457,"Host MeetupsIn the lead up to the event you should nurture your local community with monthly meetups to keep the interest alive in the topic of your event. You need to invest in your core community if you want them to act as ambassadors once the big event comes. If you don’t have time to run your own, sponsor some little events with similar attendee profiles, especially if they are user run. You can get incredible value by tapping in the actual audience that will attend the event. ",community
458,Step up your press factor ,community
459,"Do you have a press strategy for your event? Local news stations are always on the lookout for the event of the day. You really need to make sure you reach out to local press to the best of your ability. It is vital to secure as much free coverage as possible. One mention in one outlet could mean a disproportionate amount of tickets sold. Therefore make sure you reach out to local stations with a good pitch that has a story built inside. Don’t just send press releases, send a story to cover. That can be one of your performers, the type of the event. ",community
460,Step up your social media game ,community
461,"Many many times, social media handles for events wake up a couple of months before the event, only to go to sleep a month after the event is gone. In modern days, you will lose your algorithm influence on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. While it was possible in the past to keep your influence at all times, that is not the case anymore. With the recent announcements Facebook made, either you keep an ongoing strategy all year long or you are out! Other social networks are catching up so keep yourself up to date. ",community
462,Use content marketing strategically ,community
463,"If you want to rank higher on Google and convert attendees that may search for events, you need to sort out your SEO strategy. Read this comprehensive event marketing guide with hundreds of event marketing tactics to keep you on top of things. ",community
464,Behind-the-Scenes Build-up Videos ,community
465,Post videos of the set-up or exclusive clips behind-the-scenes during the day to generate a buzz. Audiences love to “see behind the curtain” so give them a glimpse of what your event has taken to get them the end result they love. ,community
466,Pre-event Q&A for Attendees ,community
467,Some attendees may be turned off by some unknowns and you haven’t been as communicative as you could have. Hosting a Q&A that is event specific not only allows you to promote the line-up and key features but can give you the option to answer any logistical questions “straight from the horse’s mouth.” ,community
468,Radio ,community
469,"Some may argue that radio is dead but it shouldn’t be underestimated. For local events, the local station can key into your target audience and raise awareness while national radio, although more expensive has a much wider reach. It is important to remember that well-known stations are used regularly by motorists so securing a top rush-hour spot will have your event heard by thousands in the car, not just for those listening at home. So, if you have the budget it is worth tapping into. Also, invite a station to coveryour event live for exclusive access and fun promotion! ",community
470,Giveaways ,community
471,"Run a giveaway to build event hype with the prize including event tickets or a VIP experience for guests! This will get everyone sharing before the event and encourages guests to follow up, plus you would hope the winner would share their experience too for a bit of FOMO! ",community
472,Snapchat Lenses ,community
473,Make these ahead of time or encourage sponsored lenses at your event so that attendees can augment their reality. These lenses allow users to create layers that interact with real-life so you could make several elements or props animated when viewed through the lens. This gets attendees interacting via Snapchat and sharing all over social media for promotion. ,community
474,Ambassadors ,community
475,This could be anyone from an industry professional to a celebrity or influencer but this involves paying them to promote your event. Use technology tools to involve your core fans to share and get a commission on each ticket sold. There are tools available to generate codes and share your event with the top contacts that may purchase a ticket. Be specific with your ambassador program. ,community
476,20 Community Event Ideas That Bring People Together ,community
477,"There’s nothing quite like a community event for creating a local call to arms or bringing people together over a common cause. Whether trying to affect local change, raise funds or simply bring a group of people together, community events can be the best way to do this if done correctly. ",community
478,"Like any event, organizing a community event comes with its own pitfalls and challenges. People need to be informed, engaged and motivated; and like any event, attendee security and safety are paramount. ",community

480,3 Considerations of Community Events: ,community
481,Protect Yourself ,community
482,"There can be increased liability with community events and this is something you’ll need to consider while planning, to make sure you can have the event that you have in mind! ",community
483,Research insurance. You will often need special types of permits and insurance when dealing with the public and the liability that goes with it so do all of your research to keep completely protected. ,community
484,"Collate your paperwork. Request and create risk assessments for certain activities e.g. those that involve risk, kids or fireworks. Ensure your paperwork is in order BEFORE the event, if you don’t you could leave yourself liable. ",community
485,Do further health and safety checks on the day to make sure everything is operating as it should be. For larger events have a dedicated health and safety officer. ,community
486,Create a Team ,community
487,They say it “takes a village” and community events have a village at their disposal so don’t be afraid to ask for help. ,community
488,Find the specialists. Is there someone in the community is a catering expert? Ask their advice for the best deals in town or who to bring in for mobile catering options. The joy of communities is that you have a network of information to tap into. Use it. ,community
489,"Get together a passionate team. The downside to community organizing is that it can snowball and you’ll find yourself with too much work or many people to manage, so keep things tight knit and delegate what you can, within reason. ",community
490,After every meeting make sure that everyone is clear on their own specific actions and deadlines. ,community
491,Think Community During Planning ,community
492,"It’s important to remember the primary objective of a community event and that is usually to benefit the community! With this in mind, aim for local sustainability and keep this in the forefront. ",community
493,Thoughtful planning: ,community
494,"Supply from local businesses. It’s for a local cause and you’re more likely to get excellent rates because the event will directly benefit them. Even better, see what they can contribute and provide. ",community
495,Consult with the community. What do they actually want from the event and how could it be achieved? ,community
496,"Think about how local schools, youth groups, churches, sports teams, local interest groups and activities can have a platform at the event. ",community
497,Ready to produce a fantastic community celebration? Here are 20 ideas that are guaranteed to be popular…. ,community
498,Pot Luck ,community
499,"A fantastic community catering idea that involves each attendee bringing a food item to contribute to the buffet table. For larger events, you want to make sure you have everything from starters to sweets so you can allocate meal (or drink) types to groups of people who can then organize with each other what they are going to specifically bring. This is an excellent way of bringing people together and starts a conversation on what everyone has brought. ",community
500,Ice Rink ,community
501,"It doesn’t have to be Winter to incorporate a fun participatory activity for your attendees because synthetic ice rinks are becoming popular. They don’t use wet ice but the best synthetics rinks can offer a comparable skating experience and can be built indoors or outdoors, even in the height of summer. Accommodating large numbers all at once, synthetic ice rinks are energy conscious and environmentally friendly. Give guests of all ages a unique experience to get active. ",community
502,"Offer cooking classes and workshops with the attendees being able to add their creations to the buffet (or sell them for fundraising.) Local restaurants could set-up a pop-up stand to accommodate in exchange for signage as an interesting sponsorship idea. Of course, you could also make it a competition too. ",community
503,Street Party/Block Party ,community
504,"While these can be difficult to get permits for (if you need to close the street), they are excellent and memorable because they involve bringing neighbors together so are more likely to become recurring. These traditions help to create safer neighborhoods and give children an opportunity for a warmer environment to grow up in. ",community
505,Pancake Breakfast ,community
506,How best to get everyone motivated for a morning event than serving a pancake breakfast? It’s delicious and fairly cost effective because you can offer a variety of topping but don’t need to worry about other catering options. ,community
507,Local Walking Tours ,community
508,"Add a walking tour to your event so that attendees can see some of the best community sites. This could be themed such as restaurants, breweries and local cuisine or opt for historical or cultural significance. ",community
509,Crowd Activated Interactive Games ,community
510,"Enhanced technology means that you can use large digital screens to display games that are controlled by audience participation. For example, audience voice activated arm wrestling involves splitting the crowd in half and giving them, two separate sounds e.g. clapping or shouting. The software picks up the sounds and the loudest sounds win the game. This results in the digital display showing it as an arm wrestling match. There are plenty of other options, from table tennis to soccer on screen, with different interaction techniques but it is bound to get the crowd pumping. ",community
511,Local Radio ,community
512,"Radio can be a big part of daily life and the broadcasters can be minor celebrities in their own right. One of the DJs could host the main stage. Make an agreement to live broadcast from the event on community or local radio to reach the attendees that can’t make it but still make them feel like part of the event. Branded vehicles and broadcast enabled vans will always cause quite a stir on site and they often have plenty of giveaways to hand out. Interview attendees of all ages and highlight local interest stories. It might encourage those that live nearby to come along, hearing about everything that is going on in the local area. ",community
513,Fitness Workshop ,community
514,"With attendees putting increasing importance on health, fitness workshops or those ideas with healthy undertones can always be a hit. Have a leader on stage taking the crowd through the warmup and exercises, play some upbeat music and get everyone moving. Although this is most effective with large open areas (festivals are also quite compatible) you can still make this work with limited space by adapting the type of exercises and opting for intermittent high-intensity moves on the spot. ",community
515,Outdoor BBQ ,community
516,"An informal catering option that breeds community and networking while being very easy to plan and instigate. Designate a griller (or grillers) for the day and make sure you start cooking early so that you are prepared when the lunchtime rush comes.

1, Summary ,roads
2, Track Record ,roads
3, Typical End Users ,roads
4, Conservation Impact ,roads
5, What You'll Need ,roads
6, Obstacles and Challenges ,roads
7, Introduction ,roads
8," For decades, municipalities—urban, suburban and rural alike—adopted street-design standards that showed strong preference to cars. However, in recent years, transportation planners have been rebalancing transportation priorities, giving attention to streets and sidewalks that can safely accommodate a wide variety of people, uses, and needs—including those of pedestrians and bicyclists—in a manner that considers community priorities and land-use implications. ",roads
9," Municipalities can greatly improve the safety and utility of their transportation infrastructure by using effective planning concepts such as complete streets, context sensitive design, and traffic calming. To translate this planning into practice, municipalities may update their subdivision and land development ordinances to require new developments to conform to the standards; municipalities may also improve existing streets and sidewalks, using funding from grants, tax revenue, or bonding. ",roads
10," This guide explains the key elements of good street and sidewalk design, their benefits, and how to implement them via municipal ordinances or direct capital investments. ",roads
11, Benefits of Good Design ,roads
12," Good street and sidewalk design provides a wealth of benefits for people, communities, and the environment, including: ",roads
13," Public Safety: Good streetscape design makes it safer to drive, walk, and bike in communities. ",roads
14," Mobility: Infrastructure that provides multiple transportation options allows people of all ages, income levels, and physical abilities to travel where they need to go. ",roads
15," Public Health: Safe connections between streets, parking lots, buildings, and destinations encourage people to walk and bike instead of drive; an active lifestyle greatly improves physical and mental health. ",roads
16," Quality of Life: Well-designed streets and sidewalks make communities more inviting and aesthetically pleasing. They also help foster positive interactions between people and increase opportunities for recreational activities like biking, jogging, and walking. ",roads
17," Economic Growth: In commercial areas, accommodating a variety of transportation options increases the number of potential consumers and employees, which can help attract new businesses. In residential areas, safe, attractive, and walkable streetscapes can boost property values. ",roads
18," Environmental Benefits: Good street and sidewalk design incorporates green infrastructure features such as rain gardens, bioswales, and filter strips. By absorbing stormwater, these features prevent flooding and keep toxic pollutants out of waterways. Other features like street trees sequester carbon and provide shade, reducing air-conditioning costs. ",roads
19, Designing Streets and Sidewalks ,roads
20, Factors to Consider ,roads
21," Deciding which types of street and sidewalk design are appropriate for your municipality involves reviewing current transportation modes (car, pedestrian, bicycle, and public transit); studying existing and potential future land uses; and assessing community needs and desires through a formal community visioning process or informal discussions. ",roads
22," Design strategies also depend on setting and affordability. For example, in rural areas, wide road shoulders may be the most feasible way to accommodate pedestrians, whereas sidewalks at least five feet wide are likely necessary in urban areas. Streetscape elements can vary from a simple landscape strip in rural settings to a variety of elements such as street trees, pedestrian lighting with banners, and hanging baskets in urban areas (see further discussion below). ",roads
23," When determining the appropriate design for streets and sidewalks, considering the following factors provides a good starting point: ",roads
24," Type of road (arterial, collector, or local road) and volume of traffic. ",roads
25," Land use (commercial, residential, mixed use, etc.). ",roads
26," Setting (rural, suburban, or urban environment) ",roads
27," Number and spacing of commercial driveways and entrances/exits—are they excessive, adequate, or insufficient? ",roads
28," Possibilities to create more useful road, pedestrian, and non-auto connections. ",roads
29, Need for traffic calming or road diets. ,roads
30, Minimum streetscape elements necessary to accomplish community goals. ,roads
31, Appropriate sidewalk width and placement given the land uses and density of uses. ,roads
32, Common Approaches ,roads
33, Among the most common approaches municipalities use to inform and guide street and sidewalk design are (1) complete streets and (2) context sensitive design. These approaches are not mutually exclusive; in many instances they overlap or complement each other. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation’s (PennDOT) Smart Transportation Guidebook: Planning and Designing Highways and Streets that Support Sustainable and Livable Communities explores many elements of these approaches in more detail. ,roads
34, Complete Streets ,roads
35," Complete streets refers to streets designed to accommodate a variety of users (pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and transit riders), including people of all ages and those with disabilities. The specific design of complete streets varies according to the community setting (i.e. rural, urban, suburban) and the type of road. ",roads
36, Sidewalks. ,roads
37, Bike lanes or wide shoulders. ,roads
38, Bus lanes and public transit stops/shelters. ,roads

42, Context Sensitive Design ,roads
43," Context sensitive design (also referred to as context sensitive solutions) is an approach to transportation infrastructure that preserves or enhances an area’s scenic, aesthetic, historic, and environmental resources and reflects community needs and priorities. A key factor in this approach is public involvement in the design and development of transportation infrastructure, which helps ensure that the end product addresses the needs of community stakeholders. ",roads
44, Typical elements of context sensitive design include: ,roads
45," Natural features such as street trees, rain gardens, hanging flower baskets, and planter boxes. ",roads
46," Street furniture that meets people’s needs while enhancing community aesthetics such as benches, recycling bins, kiosks, bike racks, and newspaper containers. ",roads
47, Signage such as banners hanging from light poles (see the guide Sign Ordinance for more information about regulating signs so they preserve or enhance community character). ,roads
48," The Georgia Department of Transportation’s Context Sensitive Design Manual provides an in-depth look at best practices, policy guidelines, communication strategies, and successful examples. See the Federal Highway Administration’s Context Sensitive Solutions and Design webpage for additional information and resources, including a number of CSD case studies. ",roads
49, Implementing Design via Capital Improvements ,roads
50," One way to implement good street and sidewalk design is to upgrade existing infrastructure. Municipalities may fund the redesign and improvement of existing streets and sidewalks with state or federal grants, tax revenue, borrowing (bonding), or some combination of the three. ",roads
51," These improvements require varying degrees of maintenance. For example, a rain garden requires a consistent upkeep, whereas a bike lane will likely last for years before it needs repainting. Often, municipalities are in charge of this maintenance, but in some cases, local businesses, nonprofits, or homeowners take on that responsibility. See the Montgomery County Planning Commission’s Making Your Downtown Improvements Last: Design, Installation, and Maintenance Guide for more information about maintenance. ",roads
52," In Pennsylvania, grant funding is available through the Department of Community and Economic Development’s Multimodal Transportation Fund and through various PennDOT grant programs. For federal grant information, see the U.S. Department of Transportation’s grants webpage. ",roads
53, Implementing Design via SALDO ,roads
54," The most effective way to control and influence street and sidewalk design is via a municipal ordinance. Generally, municipalities include street and sidewalk design regulations in their subdivision and land development ordinances (SALDOs). Less often, municipalities include these regulations in specific zoning ordinance sections that deal with design such as a Traditional Neighborhood Development district. Adopting or amending ordinance provisions requires resources (municipal staff time or the money to hire a planning/engineering consultant) and political will. ",roads
55," This section outlines how to incorporate street and sidewalk design regulations into a SALDO. For an example of an ordinance that includes many of the elements discussed below, see the Lancaster County Planning Commission’s Model Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance. ",roads
56, Design Standards ,roads
57," The design standards section of a SALDO addresses design elements for new development, and can include provisions regulating street and sidewalk design such as: ",roads
58, Minimum and maximum length and width of blocks. ,roads
59," Functional class of streets based upon the classes used by PennDOT: arterials, collectors, local roads, and private streets. These streets are often designated on a municipality’s official map (see “Integrating Transportation and Land-Use Planning”). ",roads
60," Residential private street standards including ownership, paving standards, right-of-way requirements, and maintenance procedures. ",roads
61, Number of intersections and minimum spacing between streets. ,roads
62," Street alignment and design related to sight distance, street intersections, and grade. ",roads
63, Driveway spacing related to sight distance and required permits. ,roads
64, Sidewalk width and location in relation to the curb. ,roads
65, Technical and Engineering Standards ,roads
66, The technical and engineering standards of the SALDO deal with construction standards. They often include standards for streets and sidewalks such as: ,roads
67, Paving cross-sections and materials. ,roads
68, Right-of-way requirements. ,roads
69, Sidewalk and pathway construction materials and details. ,roads
70, Driveway standards. ,roads
71," Sidewalk, curb, and curb cut standards. ",roads
72, ADA requirements. ,roads
73, Design Guidelines ,roads
74," Municipalities can further bolster street and sidewalk design improvements—and make them better understood by the public and developers—by enacting design guidelines within the SALDO or other relevant ordinances. Alternatively, the guidelines can be enacted as a separate advisory document. Common elements found in design guidelines include: ",roads
75," Illustrations and details for streets, sidewalks, parking, and bike lanes. ",roads
76, Streetscape elements. ,roads
77, Green infrastructure and landscape elements. ,roads
78, Traffic-calming measures. ,roads
79, Many municipalities have adopted design guidelines for street and sidewalk construction and retrofit design. Examples include: ,roads
80, Integrating Transportation and Land-Use Planning ,roads
81," Communities should integrate street and sidewalk design (and other transportation-related issues) into larger discussions about land-use planning; the two are inextricably linked. Transportation design and planning can and should be a key component of comprehensive plans, official maps, community visioning, and the like. ",roads

140," These are among the 10 best trees that tolerate compacted, infertile soils and the general environment found in cities and along streets and sidewalks. These recommended best curbside trees are also considered to be the most adaptable of all trees to the urban environment and are highly praised by horticulturists. ",roads
141," Messy, brittle trees that can cost property owners significant time and money for clean up are not included in this list. Several of these trees have been chosen ""Urban Tree of the Year"" as picked by The Society of Municipal Arborists (SMA). ",roads
142," Acer campestre ""Queen Elizabeth"": Hedge Maple ",roads
143," Hedge maple tolerates urban conditions with no serious pests or disease problems. Acer campestre also tolerates dry soil, compaction, and air pollutants. ",roads
144," The small stature and vigorous growth of hedge maple make this an excellent street tree for residential areas or perhaps in downtown urban sites. However, it grows a little too tall for planting beneath some power lines. It is also suitable as a patio or yard shade tree because it creates dense shade. ",roads
145," Carpinus betulus ""Fastigiata"": European Hornbeam ",roads
146," The smooth, gray, rippling bark of Carpinus betulus shields extremely hard, strong wood. Fastigiata European hornbeam, the most common hornbeam cultivar sold, grows 30 to 40 feet tall and 20 to 30 feet wide. As a very densely-foliated, columnar or oval-shaped tree it is ideal for use as a hedge, screen, or windbreak. The European hornbeam is usually preferred over American hornbeam as it grows faster with a uniform shape. ",roads
147," The Ginkgo biloba or maidenhair tree thrives in a wide range of soils and is tolerant of urban stresses. Only fruitless males should be selected. ""Princeton Sentry"" is a narrow, columnar, male form that is excellent for street planting. ",roads
148," This male cultivar of Ginkgo is practically pest-free, resistant to storm damage, and casts light shade due to the narrow crown. The tree is easily transplanted and has a vivid yellow fall color which is second to none in brilliance, even in the South. ",roads
149," Gleditsia tricanthos var. inermis or ""Shademaster"" is an excellent fast-growing street tree with essentially no fruit and dark green leaves. Many horticulturists consider this to be one of the best cultivars of North America's honeylocust. ",roads
150," Since thornless honeylocust is also one of the last trees to leaf out in springtime and one of the first to lose its leaves in fall, it is one of the few trees well-suited for planting over a lawn. The tiny leaflets of the thornless honeylocust turn golden yellow in fall before dropping and are so small they easily vanish into the grass below, without any ​raking necessary. ",roads
151," The Aristocrat's superior structure, compared to Pyrus calleyana ""Bradford,"" makes it less susceptible to wind breakage and also requires less pruning.

179, What steps can you take to ensure that your entity is in compliance with the ADA requirements for accessible curb ramps at pedestrian crossings? ,roads
180, A. Background ,roads
181," Under Project Civic Access (PCA), the Civil Rights Division works with local governments nationwide to help them achieve compliance with Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504). This Chapter discusses the ADA requirements for curb ramps at pedestrian crossings that are currently enforced by the Division under PCA. ",roads
182," Curb ramps are a small but important part of making sidewalks, street crossings, and the other pedestrian routes that make up the public right-of-way accessible to people with disabilities. But they are just one part. ",roads
183," The federal government has begun a rulemaking process to revise the accessibility requirements for public rights-of-way. The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) is developing new accessibility guidelines. The new guidelines will cover pedestrian access to sidewalks and streets, including crosswalks, curb ramps, street furnishings, pedestrian signals, parking, and other parts of the public right-of-way. The new guidelines will likely address issues such as access at street crossings for pedestrians who are blind or have low vision, wheelchair access to on-street parking, and constraints posed by space limitations, roadway design practices, slope, and terrain. On November 23, 2005, the Access Board published revised draft accessibility guidelines for public rights-of-way, which are available on its website at www.access-board.gov/prowac/index.htm. In developing these draft guidelines, the Access Board obtained recommendations from an Advisory Committee composed of representatives from disability organizations, public works departments, transportation and traffic engineering groups, the design and civil engineering professions, government agencies, and standards-setting bodies. The Advisory Committee’s report is available on the Access Board’s website at www.access-board.gov/prowac/commrept/index.htm. Although any ADA guidelines developed by the Access Board will not be enforceable under Title II of the ADA until the Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Transportation issue regulations adopting them as standards, the Access Board’s website provides information discussing accessibility concerns relating to curb ramps, sidewalks, pedestrian crossings, and other pedestrian routes. ",roads
184," Another source of information about the federal accessibility requirements for public rights-of-way is the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation. As the agency that administers the federal funding used by many state and local governments to construct highways, roads, streets, and other elements of the public right-of-way, FHWA is also responsible for implementing and enforcing the federal accessibility requirements applied to the public right-of-way. The FHWA website includes the following materials, which should be of particular interest to those entities receiving federal funds from FHWA: ",roads
185," FHWA’s notice adopting the Access Board’s draft accessibility guidelines for the public right-of-way as currently recommended best practices (www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/bikeped/prwaa.htm); and, ",roads
186," The process of adopting revised federal accessibility standards for public rights-of-way may be lengthy. In the meantime, many state and local governments will construct and alter highways, streets, roads, sidewalks, and pedestrian crossings. This Chapter is an effort to ensure that public entities do not create barriers to access by omitting curb ramps while the broader debate on accessibility requirements for public rights-of-way moves forward ",roads
187, B. What Is a Curb Ramp? ,roads
188," A curb ramp is a short ramp cutting through a curb or built up to it.1 If designed and constructed to be accessible, a curb ramp provides an accessible route that people with disabilities can use to safely transition from a roadway to a curbed sidewalk and vice versa. ",roads
189," The different parts of the most common type of curb ramp, a perpendicular curb ramp, are labeled in the illustration below. The ramp, or ramp run, is the sloped section that individuals who use wheelchairs travel up and down when transitioning between the street and the sidewalk. Transitions between the ramp and the sidewalk, gutter and street are located at the top and bottom of the ramp run. Flared sides, or flares, bring the curb itself to the level of the street. The gutter is the roadway surface immediately next to the curb ramp that runs along the curb. ",roads
190," 1 28 C.F.R. Part 36, Appendix A, § 3.4. Some people refer to curb ramps as “curb cuts"" because most curb ramps cut through the curb. ",roads
191, C. Why are Curb Ramps at Pedestrian Crossings Required? ,roads
192," It is often difficult or impossible for a person using a wheelchair, scooter, walker, or other mobility device to cross a street if the sidewalk on either side of the street ends without a curb ramp. It is also dangerous. If curb ramps are not provided, these individuals are forced to make a difficult choice. They can either stay at home and not go to their chosen destination, or they can risk their personal safety by using their wheelchairs, scooters, or walkers to travel alongside cars and other vehicles in the streets. This is a choice that people with disabilities should not be required to make. ",roads
193, D. What Does Title II of the ADA Require with Respect to Curb Ramps at Pedestrian Crossings? ,roads
194," Title II of the ADA requires state and local governments to make pedestrian crossings accessible to people with disabilities by providing curb ramps.2 This requirement applies if your state or local government has responsibility or authority over highways, streets, roads, pedestrian crossings, or walkways. Some public entities have extensive responsibility for the highways, streets, roads, pedestrian crossings, and walkways in their area, but most public entities have at least limited responsibility for them. ",roads
195," To allow people with disabilities to cross streets safely, state and local governments must provide curb ramps at pedestrian crossings and at public transportation stops where walkways intersect a curb. To comply with ADA requirements, the curb ramps provided must meet specific standards for width, slope, cross slope, placement, and other features.3 In constructing facilities such as walkways and pedestrian crossings, state and local governments can choose between two sets of standards – the ADA Standards for Accessible Design (ADA Standards) and the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS).4 Both of these standards have been deemed to comply with the requirements of Title II.5 However, state and local governments cannot pick and choose between particular portions of the ADA Standards and UFAS as they construct or alter the pedestrian crossings on a street and the curb ramps that provide access to the adjacent sidewalks. Only one of these two standards may be used for a particular facility. In the construction or alteration of roadways and walkways, this typically means that only one standard may be used for a particular construction or alteration project, and all features of that project typically must comply with the chosen standard. Departures from particular requirements of either standard by the use of other methods are permitted when it is clearly evident that equivalent access is provided.6 ",roads

197, E. What are the General Requirements for Curb Ramps in the ADA Standards for Accessible Design? ,roads
198, One way to make curb ramps compliant with Title II of the ADA is to build them in accordance with the ADA Standards.7 Following are the key characteristics of an accessible curb ramp according to the ADA Standards: ,roads
199," The ramp run has the least running slope possible. (On a curb ramp, the running slope is the slope in the direction of pedestrian travel on the ramp run.) [§ 4.8.2] ",roads
200," For curb ramps constructed after January 26, 1992 (post-ADA), the slope must be 8.33 percent (1:12) or less. [§ 4.8.2] ",roads
201," For curb ramps constructed before January 26, 1992 (pre-ADA), including those that have since been altered, the running slope must generally be 8.33 percent (1:12) or less. However, ramp runs with greater slopes are allowed for pre-ADA curb ramps in the two following instances where space limitations prohibit the use of a slope of 8.33 percent (1:12) or less: ",roads
202, The ramp run may have a running slope of up to 10 percent (1:10) if the rise is no more than six inches. [§ 4.1.6(3)(a)(i)] ,roads
203, The ramp run may have a running slope of up to 12.5 percent (1:8) if the rise is no more than three inches. [§ 4.1.6(3)(a)(ii)] ,roads
204," The rise is the vertical change measured from the low point at the base of the curb ramp to the high point at the other end where the sloped portion of the curb ramp transitions with the sidewalk. Since sidewalks often have a 2 percent or less cross slope (which is the slope perpendicular to the direction of pedestrian travel along the sidewalk) to direct water toward the street for drainage, the rise of a curb ramp is often greater than the height of the curb. ",roads
205," The cross slope of the ramp run itself may not exceed 2 percent (1:50). (On a curb ramp, the cross slope is the slope perpendicular to [across] the direction of pedestrian travel on the ramp run.) [§ 4.3.7] ",roads
206," The ramp, or ramp run, must be at least 36 inches wide, not including the flared sides. [§ 4.7.3] ",roads
207," The ramp run must have detectable warnings – i.e., dome-shaped bumps – that extend the full width and depth of the ramp. [§ 4.7.7] ",roads
208," Transitions from the ramp to the walkway, gutter, and street must be flush (level) and free of abrupt level changes. [§ 4.7.2] ",roads
209, The gutter must have a slope of no more than 5 percent (1:20) toward the ramp. [§ 4.7.2] ,roads
210, Perpendicular Curb Ramps in the ADA Standards: Flared Sides or Returned Curbs? ,roads
211," The most common type of curb ramp is the perpendicular curb ramp, which intersects the curb at a 90-degree angle. Curb ramps must have flared sides if people are required to walk across them. [§ 4.7.5] The slope requirements for the flared sides depend on the width of the sidewalk at the top of the ramp, “x” in the illustration to the right. If “x” is less than 48 inches, then the slope of the flared sides must be no more than 8.33 percent (1:12). If “x” is 48 inches or more, then the flared sides may slope up to 10 percent (1:10) but not more. [§ 4.7.5; Fig. 12(a)] ",roads
212," When pedestrians are not required to walk across the ramp, such as where there is a non-walking surface (grass, for example) or obstructions on both sides of a curb ramp, curb ramps are allowed to have returned curbs. A curb ramp with returned curbs is required to have a landing with maneuvering space at the top of the ramp (“x” in the illustration to the left) that is at least 48 inches because people using mobility devices need an area to turn when getting on and off the ramp. [§ 4.7.5; Fig. 12(b)] ",roads
213, F. What are Pedestrian Crossings and Where Must Curb Ramps be Provided? ,roads
214, Where and when curb ramps are required depends on the location and the age of streets and sidewalks. ,roads
215, 1. Location ,roads
216," Generally, you must provide curb ramps wherever a sidewalk or other pedestrian walkway crosses a curb. Curb ramps must be placed to enable a person with a mobility disability to travel from a sidewalk on one side of the street, over or through any curbs or traffic islands, to the sidewalk on the other side of the street. Remember, walkways include areas where people must walk to access bus stops and other public transportation stops, so, where necessary, curb ramps must also be provided to enable people with disabilities to board and exit public transportation. ",roads
217, 2. Age of Streets and Sidewalks ,roads
218," In addition, the requirements vary depending on the age of a highway, road, street, or sidewalk, and depending on when and whether it was paved, repaved, resurfaced beyond normal maintenance, or otherwise altered. ",roads
219," “Pre-ADA” streets, sidewalks, roads, and highways are those that were built before January 26, 1992, and have not since been altered. ",roads
220," “Alterations” are another category of construction under the ADA. A street or sidewalk falls into this category if it was constructed pre-ADA (construction began before January 26, 1992), and has since been altered. What does “altered” mean? An alteration is a change that affects usability. Resurfacing a roadway beyond normal maintenance is an alteration. By contrast, filling potholes is not.8 ",roads
221," For purposes of the ADA, any street or sidewalk is “new” or “post-ADA” if its construction commenced after January 26, 1992.9 ",roads
222, 7 The bracketed references in this section refer to the applicable sections of the ADA Standards 8 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(b). 9 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(a). ,roads
223, 3. New Construction vs. Alterations ,roads
224," The requirements in the ADA Standards for curb ramps newly constructed post-ADA (construction commenced after January 26, 1992) can be found in § 4.7. The requirements for curb ramps that have been altered post-ADA are the same, except for in the following cases. ",roads
225," When pre-ADA streets or sidewalks are altered, there may be space limitations that restrict how much they can be altered to install accessible curb ramps. In these cases, the curb ramps installed must meet the accessibility requirements of the ADA to the maximum extent feasible.10 Scoping requirements in the ADA Standards establish limitations for the running slope of the ramp run of curb ramps installed during alterations to pre-ADA streets and walkways.11 ",roads
226," The Civil Rights Division recognizes that there will be very rare instances when it will be technically infeasible for a curb ramp installed during alterations to pre-ADA roadways and walkways to be constructed in full and strict compliance with the requirements of ADA Standards § 4.1.6(3)(a) and § 4.7 because of physical or site constraints. In such circumstances, state and local governments must install curb ramps that provide accessibility to the maximum extent feasible.12 Before reaching a conclusion about technical infeasibility, state and local governments need to consider the extent to which physical or site constraints can be addressed by alternative curb ramp designs. The burden of proving technical infeasibility lies with the state or local government that constructed it. ",roads
227, Alternative Curb Ramp Designs ,roads
228, A parallel curb ramp consists of two ramps joined in the middle by a landing that is level with the roadway. Parallel curb ramps run parallel to the curb and usually take up the whole width of the sidewalk. ,roads
229," Combined curb ramps are a combination of the perpendicular and parallel curb ramp designs. The combined curb ramp breaks the elevation change between the curb and the street into two parts, and uses a separate ramp to bridge each part: a parallel ramp from the sidewalk to a level landing, and a perpendicular ramp from the level landing to the roadway. ",roads
230, 10 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(b). 11 ADA Standards § 4.1.6(3)(a). 12 ADA Standards § 4.1.6(1)(j). ,roads
231," When highways, streets, and roads are built or altered post-ADA, they must have curb ramps at certain locations. Curb ramps must be located wherever there are curbs or other barriers to entry from a pedestrian walkway or sidewalk, including any intersection where it is legal for a pedestrian to cross the street, whether or not there is any designated crosswalk. Curb ramps must also be located wherever there are curbs or other barriers to entry at any designated pedestrian crosswalks that are located mid-block. Likewise, when sidewalks or walkways are built or altered post-ADA, they must include curb ramps or other sloped areas wherever they intersect with highways, streets, or roads and pedestrians may legally cross the vehicular way as well as at public transportation stops. ",roads
232," By contrast, for pre-ADA highways, streets, roads, and sidewalks that have not been altered, state and local governments may choose to construct curb ramps at every point where a pedestrian walkway intersects a curb. However, they are not necessarily required to do so. Under a more flexible standard called “program access,” alternative routes to buildings may be acceptable where people with disabilities must travel only a marginally longer route than the general public. ",roads
233, 4. Example: Installing Curb Ramps for Program Accessibility ,roads
234," Consider a case where the streets and sidewalks in a small town were built pre-ADA and have not been altered since. Some intersections have curb ramps; most do not. The town is trying to figure out where to install curb ramps to provide access to the town hall. The accessible entrance to the town hall is located on North Street, which is on the north side of the building. The parking garage that serves the town hall is located on North Street, directly across the street from the town hall’s accessible entrance. Public transportation stops serving the town hall are in a residential neighborhood on East Street, two blocks east of the town hall. The town is evaluating where it needs to install curb ramps to comply with Title II requirements. ",roads
235," Since the town hall and its surrounding streets and sidewalks were built pre-ADA and have not since been altered, the town must install curb ramps in compliance with Title II’s program access requirements for pre-ADA facilities. Under these requirements, the town may choose to install curb ramps at all pedestrian crossings on the sidewalks surrounding the town hall, but it is not necessarily required to do so. A program access approach would require the town to install curb ramps at key pedestrian crossings. To provide access to the town hall, curb ramps would need to be installed at the pedestrian crossings and transportation stops along North and East streets so people with disabilities can travel along a pedestrian route between (1) the accessible entrance to the town hall and the accessible entrance to the parking garage and (2) the accessible entrance to the town hall and the public transportation stops on East Street. In this instance, installing curb ramps at the pedestrian crossings on the south side of the townhall are not needed from a program access perspective to enable people with disabilities to access the town hall. However, they may be needed from a program access perspective for other reasons, such as providing access to other town facilities served by the parking garage or to the town’s business district. The town should seek input from people with mobility disabilities regarding the other key locations where curb ramps need to be installed to provide program access. ",roads
236," G. What are Detectable Warnings, Why are They Required, and Where Must They be Provided? ",roads
237," The ADA Standards require that curb ramps include features called “detectable warnings.” Detectable warnings consist of a series of small domes that contrast in color with the surrounding sidewalk or street. They must be integrated into the walking surface, and there are specific measurements for the size and spacing of the domes.13 ",roads
238," What is the function of detectable warnings? Detectable warnings are intended to function much like stop signs for pedestrians who are blind or have low vision. The warnings, which are intended to be felt with pedestrians’ feet, alert blind individuals and those with low vision that they are about to enter a street or other area where cars pass. A detectable warning alerts pedestrians who are blind or have low vision that they need to stop and determine the nature of the hazard – such as whether there is passing traffic – before continuing on their way. ",roads
239," Under the ADA Standards, curb ramps are required to have detectable warnings that extend the full width and depth of the curb ramp.14 An example of a perpendicular curb ramp that complies with this requirement can be seen to the left. ",roads
240," The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), however, is encouraging the use of a different design for detectable warnings.15 Under this design, detectable warnings extend the whole width of the ramp, but cover only the two feet of the ramp closest to the street. DOT has deemed this departure from the ADA Standards to be permitted under Title II of the ADA.16 An example of a curb ramp that complies with the DOT’s design can be seen on the right. H. How Can You Tell if a Curb Ramp is Accessible? ",roads
241," The best way to determine if a curb ramp is accessible is to survey it to determine the extent to which it complies with ADA accessibility requirements. To assist you, the next installment of this Tool Kit will include instructions on how to survey curb ramps for compliance with the ADA Standards and a Curb Ramps survey form for use in conducting your surveys. The instructions, which will be located in Appendix 1, are keyed to the Curb Ramps survey form, which will be located in Appendix 2, and will provide an explanation of how to obtain the information needed to answer each question on the survey form. The instructions will also include photographs and illustrations showing how and where to take measurements. The Curb Ramps survey form and instructions will help you identify the most common accessibility problems with curb ramps, but they will not necessarily identify all problems. ",roads
242, 13 ADA Standards § 4.29.2. 14 ADA Standards § 4.7.7. 15 DOT’s memorandum encouraging use of this alternate design for detectable warnings is available on its website at www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/bikeped/dwm.htm. 16 28 C.F.R. § 35.151(c) ,roads
243, I. Ensuring Compliance Now and In the Future ,roads
244," Now that you know some of the basic ADA requirements for providing curb ramps at pedestrian crossings, you can assess whether your entity is in compliance with these requirements. Here are some steps you can take: ",roads
245," Assess the extent to which your entity has complied with ADA requirements for providing curb ramps at pedestrian crossings and transportation stops. Use the Checklist in the Addendum to this Chapter to guide you in conducting a preliminary assessment. To survey curb ramps in your community, use the Curb Ramps survey form and instructions that will be included in the Appendices to this Tool Kit, which will be released soon. ",roads
246," After conducting your assessment to figure out where ADA compliant curb ramps are needed, prioritize the locations. If locations constructed or altered post-ADA do not have ADA-compliant curb ramps, they must be installed at all of those locations. Other priorities include, in descending order, curb ramps at pre-ADA locations with pedestrian crossings providing access to local government facilities, bus stops and other transportation services, public accommodations, business districts, and residential areas. ",roads
247," Next, make a long-range plan to provide curb ramps in locations that need them. When making the plan, include other local government staff who will be involved, such as employees from the transportation department and employees in charge of budget matters. Set a series of progress dates for curb ramp compliance based on priorities and reasonable time frames. The actual number of curb ramps installed in any given year may be limited by fiscal constraints, consistent with the fundamental alteration and undue burden limitations discussed in Chapter 1 of the Tool Kit. However, the plan should address the steps your entity will take over a specific time period to come into compliance with Title II requirements. ",roads
248," Establish written procedures for soliciting and receiving input on the accessibility of pedestrian crossings and transportation stops from people with disabilities. As part of these procedures, establish an ongoing program for installing curb ramps upon request in both residential and nonresidential areas.17 Integrate these requests into your long-range plan. This program will put your entity on the right track for the future. ",roads
249," Develop a written policy ensuring that, effective immediately, ADA-compliant curb ramps will be provided at any intersection having curbs or other barriers to entry from a sidewalk whenever a street, road, or highway is constructed or altered. If your entity receives federal financial assistance, the policy should also address compliance with Section 504. ",roads
250," Develop a written policy ensuring that, effective immediately, ADA-compliant curb ramps will be provided at all newly constructed or altered sidewalks and walkways where they intersect a street, road, or highway, including mid-block pedestrian crossings and public transportation stops. If pedestrians may legally cross a street at an intersection that you are constructing or altering, curb ramps must be provided. ",roads
251," Working with employees in the transportation department, review the designs for curb ramps and detectable warnings to ensure that they are ADA-compliant. If your entity receives federal financial assistance, they also should be reviewed for compliance with Section 504. Many states and localities have standardized designs for common features such as curb ramps, and sometimes these designs do not comply with ADA and, if applicable, Section 504 requirements. If your curb ramp designs, including the details for detectable warnings, do not comply with Title II requirements your entity needs to change them immediately so they do. ",roads
252," Many sidewalks and roads become the responsibility of public entities after they are built by private developers and deeded over to the public entity following construction. Often, in these circumstances, private developers (who are not bound by Title II’s requirements when acting on their own behalf) have not provided the curb ramps at pedestrian crossings, transportation stops, and other locations that the ADA requires public entities to provide. When these facilities are deeded over to them, public entities also receive the legal responsibility for installing ADA-compliant curb ramps which previously may not have existed. But public entities can use their authority under zoning and land use laws, as well as plan review processes, to ensure that private developers comply with the accessibility requirements that public entities deem appropriate. Some communities that understand the liability they can incur in receiving such property refuse to accept property that has not been built in compliance with ADA requirements. ",roads
253," Most public entities include provisions in their contracts for services with architects, engineers, and contractors requiring compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws. However, many architects, engineers, and contractors do not understand that these provisions require compliance with ADA requirements. When preparing contracts for services by architects, engineers, and contractors involved in building and altering highways, streets, roads, sidewalks, other walkways, transportation stops, and curb ramps, consider including a provision specifically requiring compliance with Title II of the ADA, including compliance with the ADA Standards or UFAS. Remember, public entities may not use the elevator exception contained in ADA Standards, § 4.1.3(5). While elevators will rarely be implicated in the design and construction of pedestrian crossings, they will be implicated in many other types of public facilities constructed by or on behalf of public entities. For this reason, a contractual provision requiring compliance with the ADA Standards should make clear that the elevator exception contained in § 4.1.3(5) of the Standards does not apply. If your entity receives federal financial assistance, consider a similar provision requiring compliance with Section 504 requirements as well. ",roads
254," Where compliance with federal law is contractually required, consider requiring your architects, engineers, and contractors to certify ADA compliance, including compliance with the ADA Standards (excluding the elevator exception in § 4.1.3(5) of the Standards) or UFAS, before accepting, and making final payments for, their work. If your entity receives federal financial assistance, consider requiring architects, engineers, and contractors to certify compliance with Section 504 requirements as well. ",roads

406,INTRODUCTION,roads
407,Typical sections describe the physical shape and relationship of the various highway elements that,roads
408,are present at or proposed for a normal or typical interval along a highway. This chapter defines and,roads
409,describes the elements and presents guidance on details of their design. It also discusses how the,roads
410,individual elements may be brought together to form typical sections for the different classifications,roads
411,of highways.,roads
412,"The chapter begins by defining, in Section 3.1.1, the elements that make up typical sections and",roads
413,"follows, in 3.1.2, with a description of the two highway classification systems used in this chapter.",roads
414,Section 3.2 presents discussions of the individual elements as they relate to new construction.,roads
415,"Section 3.3 focuses on some of these elements as they relate to resurfacing, restoration and",roads
416,"rehabilitation work on existing facilities. Section 3.4 provides guidance on drawing layout,",roads
417,"conventions, notes and general presentation of typical sections for construction contracts. It also",roads
418,includes example drawings. Section 3.5 provides references for the many documents that provide,roads
419,supplementary information relevant to the preparation of typical sections.,roads
420,3.1.1 Element Terminology and Definitions,roads
421,Tables 3-1 and 3-2 present definitions of elements that may be included in the typical sections of,roads
422,new or reconstructed projects. Different arrangements of elements will be used depending on the,roads
423,functional classification of the highway. Figure 3-1 illustrates a typical arrangement for a limited,roads
424,access highway. Figure 3-2 illustrates an arrangement of elements for urban streets. (Two tables,roads

603,ELEMENTS OF THE TYPICAL SECTION,roads
604,The discussion of the typical section elements is organized sequentially starting with the horizontal,roads
605,control line and working out to the Right-of-way line. For the dimensions or minimum widths of,roads
606,critical design elements for new and reconstructed highways and for 3R projects on interstates and,roads
607,"freeways, reference should be made to Chapter 2. Although not called out for each element, there",roads
608,"are separate corresponding standards for non-freeway resurfacing, restoration and rehabilitation",roads
609,(3R) projects found in Chapter 7.,roads
610,3.2.1 Control Lines,roads
611,"Collectively, the control lines determine the location of the typical section in space. There are three",roads
612,components to this spatial control.,roads
613,"The ""horizontal control line"", or HCL, is the control for the horizontal alignment. The stationing for",roads
614,the roadway is measured along this line. In situations where the HCL is located in the middle of the,roads
615,"traveled way, between lanes, the term ""centerline"" is used. When a centerline is shown as the",roads
616,"horizontal control, it is not necessary to also call it the HCL.",roads
617,"The ""theoretical grade line"", or TGL, is the control for the vertical alignment. The roadway profile is",roads
618,measured along this line. The TGL is usually located on the theoretical pavement surface at the,roads
619,HCL.,roads
620,"The ""point of rotation"", or POR, is the point on the pavement surface about which adjoining lanes",roads
621,rotate up or down during superelevation transitions. The POR will usually be located at the same,roads
622,lane edge as the TGL. The location of the POR only needs to be indicated on sections when it is,roads
623,different from the location of the TGL.,roads
624,"Baselines are not shown on typical sections, but should be shown on alignment plans. (See",roads
625,"Chapter 21, Section 21.2.) Baselines are established as straight line segments between known",roads
626,"fixed points, generally within the right-of-way. They are located for the convenience of the surveyors",roads
627,and provide the initial control for all of the preliminary survey work and subsurface exploration.,roads
628,3.2.2 Lane Widths,roads
629,A highway lane is the portion of the traveled way dedicated to the sole use of a single line of,roads
630,"vehicles. Lane width is a ""critical design element"" discussed in Chapter 2. Refer to that chapter",roads
631,for design widths to be used for travel lanes on new and reconstructed highways and 3R projects,roads
632,on interstates and freeways. (The guidance for non-freeway 3R projects is provided in Chapter 7.),roads

636,3-7,roads
637,3.2.3 Cross Slope and Superelevation of Lanes,roads
638,Pavement cross slope and superelevation of lanes are two of the critical design elements covered,roads
639,in Chapter 2. That chapter presents the minimum and maximum values that should be used for the,roads
640,"various functional classifications of highways. The normal cross slope is 2% for travel lanes, 4%",roads
641,"for parking lanes and 6% for shoulders. Generally, a ‘normal crown section’ is considered to be one",roads
642,in which the travel lanes slope at 2% away from the point of rotation. Chapter 2 also presents,roads
643,"Tables 2-9, 2-10 and 2-11 which, in addition to providing the radius/design speed/superelevation",roads
644,"correlations that shall be used, give the minimum runoff lengths for superelevation transitions. (Note",roads
645,"again the existence of separate non-freeway 3R standards. See Chapter 7, Section 7.3.)",roads
646,3.2.4 Pavement Sections,roads
647,A typical section drawing shall indicate the type of pavement materials to be used and the required,roads
648,thicknesses of the various layers. These are two separate operations. The structural thickness,roads
649,requirements will be either conventionally determined (Section 3.2.4.3) or be by ESAL-based design,roads
650,"(Section 3.2.4.4). In general, pavement material type will be either Portland Cement Concrete",roads
651,"(PCC) or Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA). Within HMA, however, the material may be either ‘SUPERPAVE‘",roads
652,"asphalt or, for most of 1999, ‘conventional’ Marshall Mix asphalt. In some instances, the placement",roads
653,requirements for the SUPERPAVE courses will require slight increases in the thicknesses used in,roads
654,conventional designs. SUPERPAVE guidance is contained in Section 3.2.4.5. Guidance on,roads
655,conventional asphalt item selection is contained in Appendix A.,roads
656,"In normal, full-scale production work, HMA must be compacted by either static or vibratory rollers.",roads
657,"In some instances, it is possible that vibratory compaction could lead to damage of particularly",roads
658,sensitive structures. Particular concern should be given to urban areas where there are old utility,roads
659,pipes under the pavement and/or vulnerable buildings nearby. The action of the vibratory compactor,roads
660,"may also have a detrimental effect on some underlying soil conditions, particularly if the soil is fine",roads
661,grained and the groundwater elevation is close to the surface. The Regional Geotechnical Engineer,roads
662,and/or the Regional Materials Engineer should be consulted to determine if either problem should,roads
663,"be anticipated. If either Engineer judges that vibration sensitivity is likely to be a problem, a Special",roads
664,"Note should be inserted in the proposal, stating “Vibratory compaction is prohibited at certain",roads
665,locations within this project. Check the Plans for specific locations.” The Engineer may,roads
666,"(also) judge that vibratory compaction may be a problem at certain locations. In this case, a Special",roads
667,Note should (also) be included in the Proposal stating that “Areas that may have vibration,roads
668,sensitivity problems are indicated on the Plans. The use of vibratory compaction in these,roads
669,"areas shall be strictly at the Contractor’s risk.” The Plans and, when practical, the proposal",roads
670,should be specific as to the areas where the Special Notes will apply. Refer to the subsection on,roads
671,‘Neighborhood Sensitivity’ (under Section 3.2.4.5) and to the subsection on ‘Field Compaction,roads
672,Procedures’ (under Section 3.2.4.5 B) for a discussion of compaction monitoring procedures in,roads
673,potentially vibration sensitive areas.,roads
674,"To verify that PCC pavements have been placed with a smooth, comfortably rideable surface, a",roads
675,profilograph may be used to measure the cumulative roughness of the finished concrete. On all,roads

686,contractor to provide a profilograph for the Engineer's use at a lump sum price.,roads
687,3.2.4.1 Selection of Pavement Type,roads
688,Each significant pavement-related project should be carefully evaluated to determine the most,roads
689,"appropriate type of pavement for new or reconstruction projects or, as discussed in Section 3.3, the",roads
690,most appropriate rehabilitation treatment for existing pavements. The current emphasis is to,roads
691,examine life cycle cost rather than first cost. Only a general overview of the process is presented,roads
692,below. The selection process is outlined in greater detail in Engineering Instruction 92-015 Project,roads
693,Level Pavement Selection Process.,roads
694,The first step in the selection process is to define one or more suitable treatment options. For new,roads
695,"or reconstructed pavements, preliminary designs must be prepared for both PCC and HMA",roads
696,"alternatives. Sections 3.2.4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 discuss the procedure for determining suitable new and",roads
697,"reconstructed section compositions. For existing pavements, some of the other treatment options",roads
698,are discussed under Section 3.3.,roads
699,The second step in the process is to compare the suitable options by performing a Life-Cycle Cost,roads
